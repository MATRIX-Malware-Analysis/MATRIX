    "description": "A database server is a server which uses a database application that provides database services to other computer programs or to computers, as defined by the client-server model. Database management systems (DBMSs) frequently provide database-server functionality, and some database management systems (such as MySQL) rely exclusively on the client-server model for database access (while others e.g. SQLite are meant for using as an embedded database). For clarification, a database server is simply a server that maintains services related to clients via database applications."
