    "x_kb_abstract": "A system and method for retrieval and analysis of stored objects for malware is described. The method involves receiving a scan request message from a customer to conduct analytics on one or more objects stored within a third-party controlled service. In response to receipt of the scan request message, the system generates a redirect message. The redirect message redirects the customer to an authentication portal of the third-party controlled service operating as a logon page and configures receipt by the system of access credentials for the third-party controlled service upon verification of the customer. Using the access credentials, the system is able to retrieve the one or more objects using the access credentials and performing analytics on each object of the one or more objects to classify each object as malicious or benign.",
