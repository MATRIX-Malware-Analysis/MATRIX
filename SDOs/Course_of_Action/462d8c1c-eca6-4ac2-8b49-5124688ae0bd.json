    "x_kb_abstract": "The pointer authentication scheme introduced by ARM is a software security primitive that makes it much harder for an attacker to modify protected pointers in memory without being detected. In this document, we will provide more details about the Pointer Authentication mechanism, provide a security analysis, and discuss the implementation of certain software security countermeasures, such as stack protection and control flow integrity, using the Pointer Authentication primitives.",
