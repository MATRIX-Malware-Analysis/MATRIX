Files may also be compared against a source of ground truth such as cryptographic signatures. Examining files for potential malware using pattern matching against file contents/file behavior. Binary code may be dissembled and analyzed for predictive malware behavior, such as API call signatures. Analysis might occur within a protected environment such as a sandbox or live system."
