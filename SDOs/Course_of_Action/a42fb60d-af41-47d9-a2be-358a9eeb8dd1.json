    "x_kb_abstract": "LUKS is short for \"Linux Unified Key Setup\". It has initially been developed to remedy the unpleasantness a user experienced that arise from deriving the encryption setup from changing user space, and forgotten command line arguments. The result of this changes are an unaccessible encryption storage. The reason for this to happen was, a unstandardised way to read, process and set up encryption keys, and if the user was unlucky, he upgraded to an incompatible version of user space tools that needed a good deal of knowledge to use with old encryption volumes.",
