    "description": "In computer science, a record (also called struct or compound data) is a basic data structure. A record is a collection of fields, possibly of different data types, typically in fixed number and sequence . The fields of a record may also be called members, particularly in object-oriented programming. Fields may also be called elements, though these risk confusion with the elements of a collection. A tuple may or may not be considered a record, and vice versa, depending on conventions and the specific programming language."
