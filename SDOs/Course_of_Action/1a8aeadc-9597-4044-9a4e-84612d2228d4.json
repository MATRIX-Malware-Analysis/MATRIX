This information may be collected for future comparisons.\n\nChanges in firmware hash values may indicate that the firmware has been tampered with or that firmware images are not maintained to current baselined versions, or even known vulnerable versions are deployed.\n\n## Considerations\n* Trust baselines will need to be generated for specific devices\n* Changes to trusted configurations will need to be managed across the enterprise"
