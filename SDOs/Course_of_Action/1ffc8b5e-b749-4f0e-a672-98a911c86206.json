    "description": "A job scheduler software is operating system software that when run executes scheduled tasks (time-scheduling in the sense of wall clock time; not operating system scheduling of processes for multitasking). Processes running such software are task scheduler processes. In Windows, Scheduled Tasks are created and managed by the Task Scheduler. In Unix-like OSes, the `cron` utitility serves a similar role.",
