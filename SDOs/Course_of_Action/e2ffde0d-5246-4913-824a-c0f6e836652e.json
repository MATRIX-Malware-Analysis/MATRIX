    "description": "An unit test execution tool automatically performs unit testing.  Unit testing is a software testing method by which individual units of source code are tested to determine whether they are fit for use.  Unit test execution tools work with sets of one or more computer program modules together with associated control data, usage procedures, and operating procedures. This contrasts with integration testing, which tests inter-unit dependencies and the modules as a group."
