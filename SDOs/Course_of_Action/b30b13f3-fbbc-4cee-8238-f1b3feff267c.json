One or more security software components may be injected into firmware binary to create a modified firmware binary, which is functionally- and size-equivalent to the original firmware binary. The security software components may retrieve live forensic information related to embedded devices for use in live hardening of the modified firmware binary while the embedded device is online, dynamically patching the firmware",
