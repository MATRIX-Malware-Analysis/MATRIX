    "x_kb_abstract": "Example techniques locate or identify malware based on events from or at monitored computing devices. A control unit can detect a sequence of events of various types. The control unit can locate a loop within the sequence of events based at least in part on relative frequencies of the event types. The control unit can determine a distribution of event types of the events within the loop, and determining that software running the sequence is associated with malware based at least in part on the distribution of event types within the loop. In some examples, the control unit can locate a point of commonality among a plurality of stack traces associated with respective events within the loop. The control unit can determine a malware module comprising the point of commonality.",

    "x_kb_mitre_analysis": "The patent describes determining if a sequence of events associated with a process are associated with malware. Based on the relative frequency of events, a loop within a sequence of events is located and a distribution of the events within the loop is determined. The distribution of events is then compared against a catalog of distributions to determine if it is associated with malware.",
