    "x_kb_abstract": "In particular embodiments, a data processing data inventory generation system is configured to: (1) generate a data model (e.g., a data inventory) for one or more data assets utilized by a particular organization; (2) generate a respective data inventory for each of the one or more data assets; and (3) map one or more relationships between one or more aspects of the data inventory, the one or more data assets, etc. within the data model. In particular embodiments, a data asset (e.g., data system, software application, etc.) may include, for example, any entity that collects, processes, contains, and/or transfers personal data (e.g., such as a software application, \u201cinternet of things\u201d computerized device, database, website, data-center, server, etc.). The system may be configured to identify particular data assets and/or personal data in data repositories using any suitable intelligent identity scanning technique.",
