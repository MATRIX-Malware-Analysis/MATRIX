    "x_kb_abstract": "Data transfer is controlled between a first network and a second network of computers by a firewall-proxy combination. Active interpretation of protocol commands exchanged between the first network and the second network is performed to determine specific actions concerning completion of the protocol request. This active firewall-proxy combination may exist on either the first or second network of computers. This method of control provides centralized control and administration for all potentially reachable resources within a network.",
