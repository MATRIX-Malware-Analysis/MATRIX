    "description": "A software artifact server provides access to the software artifacts in a software repository. A software repository, or \"repo\" for short, is a storage location for software packages. Often a table of contents is stored, as well as metadata. Repositories group packages. Sometimes the grouping is for a programming language, such as CPAN for the Perl programming language, sometimes for an entire operating system, sometimes the license of the contents is the criteria. At client side, a package manager helps installing from and updating the repositories."
