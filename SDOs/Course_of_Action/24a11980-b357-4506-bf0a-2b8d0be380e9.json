    "description": "In computing, a hard link is a directory entry that associates a name with a file on a file system. All directory-based file systems must have at least one hard link giving the original name for each file. The term \"hard link\" is usually only used in file systems that allow more than one hard link for the same file. Multiple hard links -- that is, multiple directory entries to the same file -- are supported by POSIX-compliant and partially POSIX-compliant operating systems, such as Linux, Android, macOS, and also Windows NT4 and later Windows NT operating systems."
