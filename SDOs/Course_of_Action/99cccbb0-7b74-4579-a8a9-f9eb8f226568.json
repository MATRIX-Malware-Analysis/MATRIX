    "description": "A partition is a fixed-size subset of a storage device which is treated as a unit by the operating system. A partition table is a table maintained on the storage device by the operating system describing the partitions on that device. The terms partition table and partition map are most commonly associated with the MBR partition table of a Master Boot Record (MBR) in IBM PC compatibles, but it may be used generically to refer to other \"formats\" that divide a disk drive into partitions, such as: GUID Partition Table (GPT), Apple partition map (APM), or BSD disklabel."
