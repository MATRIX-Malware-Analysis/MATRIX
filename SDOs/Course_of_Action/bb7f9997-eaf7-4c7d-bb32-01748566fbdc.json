    "x_kb_abstract": "The Windows Task Manager may be used to dump the memory space of lsass.exe to disk for processing with a credential access tool such as Mimikatz. This is performed by launching Task Manager as a privileged user, selecting lsass.exe, and clicking \"Create dump file\". This saves a dump file to disk with a deterministic name that includes the name of the process being dumped.\n\nThis requires filesystem data to determine whether files have been created.",
