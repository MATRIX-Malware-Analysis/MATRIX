    "x_kb_abstract": "Various embodiments pertain to communication network systems. In particular, various embodiments relate to multi-path probing in communication network systems that can be used to estimate the complete topology of the network. A method includes receiving data at a source node from a tracerouting probe in a network. The data includes information about at least one network node. The method also includes determining an identification for the at least one network node based on information. In addition, the method includes using the identification of the at least one network node to determine an identification of at least one device.",
