They are built upon the World Wide Web Consortium's (W3C) standard for objects called the Resource Description Framework (RDF). OWL classes correspond to description logic (DL) _concepts_.  OWL properties to DL _roles_, and individuals are named the same way in OWL and other DLs.\n\n## References\n1. Web Ontology Language. (2023, April 23). In _Wikipedia_.
