    "description": "In computing, a login session is the period of activity between a user logging in and logging out of a (multi-user) system. On Unix and Unix-like operating systems, a login session takes one of two main forms: (a) When a textual user interface is used, a login session is represented as a kernel session -- a collection of process groups with the logout action managed by a session leader, and (b) Where an X display manager is employed, a login session is considered to be the lifetime of a designated user process that the display manager invokes."
