    "x_kb_abstract": "Masquerading (T1036) is defined by ATT&CK as follows:\n\n\u201cMasquerading occurs when the name or location of an object, legitimate or malicious, is manipulated or abused for the sake of evading defenses and observation. This may include manipulating file metadata, tricking users into misidentifying the file type, and giving legitimate task or service names.\u201d\n\nMalware authors often use this technique to hide malicious executables behind legitimate Windows executable names (e.g. lsass.exe, svchost.exe, etc).\n\nThere are several sub-techniques, but this analytic focuses on Match Legitimate Name or Location only.",
