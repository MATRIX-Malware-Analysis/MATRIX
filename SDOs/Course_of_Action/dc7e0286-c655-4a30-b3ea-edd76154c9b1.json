    "description": "In homogeneous transfer learning, the feature spaces of the source and target domains is of the same dimension (Ds\u2009=\u2009Dt) while the data of both domains is represented by the same attributes (Xs\u2009=\u2009Xt) and labels (Ys\u2009=\u2009Yt). Thus, homogeneous transfer learning aims to bridge the gap in the data distributions experienced during cross-domain transfer.",
