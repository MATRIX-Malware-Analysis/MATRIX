It is broken into parts to make the role of each part clear. All parts are required in order to constitute a complete standard. For a complete definition of all requirements necessary to build a TPM, the designer will need to use the appropriate platform-specific specification to understand all of the requirements for a TPM in a specific application or make appropriate choices as an implementer. Those wishing to create a TPM need to be aware that this specification does not provide a complete picture of the options and commands necessary to implement a TPM. To implement a TPM the designer needs to refer to the relevant platform-specific specification to understand the options and settings required for a TPM in a specific type of platform or make appropriate choices as an implementer.",
