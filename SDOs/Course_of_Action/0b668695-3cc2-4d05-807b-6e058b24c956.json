    "x_kb_abstract": "After compromising a network of systems, threat actors often try to delete Shadow Copy in an attempt to prevent administrators from restoring the systems to versions present before the attack. This is often done via vssadmin, a legitimate Windows tool to interact with shadow copies. This non-detection of this technique, which is often employed by ransomware strains such as \u201cOlympic Destroyer\u201d, may lead to a failure in recovering systems after an attack.",
