    "x_kb_article": "## How it works\n\nCertificate-based authentication is a security mechanism that uses digital certificates to verify the identity of a user, device, or server before granting access to a network or system. This method relies on a pair of cryptographic keys: a public key and a private key.\n\n## Considerations\n\n* Private Key Protection: Ensure that private keys are securely stored and protected against unauthorized access.\n* Certificate Revocation: Implement a robust process for revoking certificates if they are compromised or no longer needed.\n* Man-in-the Middle Attacks: Use mutual authentication to mitigate the risk of these attacks."
