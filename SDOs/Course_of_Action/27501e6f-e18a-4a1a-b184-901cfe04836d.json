    "x_kb_article": "## How it works\nHosts/users within a computer network are analyzed to identify communities of hosts which frequently communicate. Future communications between communities that don't usually communicate can then be detected.  For example, if a community of hosts that communicate in support of a company's finance division suddenly starts to access the code server usually accessed only by engineers, this may indicate unauthorized activity.\n\n## Considerations\n* Potential for false positives in very dynamic network environments.\n* Attackers that move low and slow may not differentiate their behavior enough to trigger an alert."
