    "description": "A network session is a temporary and interactive information interchange between two or more devices communicating over a network. A session is established at a certain point in time, and then 'torn down' - brought to an end - at some later point. An established communication session may involve more than one message in each direction. A session is typically stateful, meaning that at least one of the communicating parties needs to hold current state information and save information about the session history in order to be able to communicate, as opposed to stateless communication, where the communication consists of independent requests with responses. Network sessions may be established and implemented as part of protocols and services at the application, session, or transport layers of the OSI model."
