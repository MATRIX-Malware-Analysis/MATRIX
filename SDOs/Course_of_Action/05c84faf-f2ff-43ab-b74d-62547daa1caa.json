Defenders may choose to suspend rather than terminate to analyze the process first and resume the process if deemed benign.\n\n### System-provided functions\n\n#### Windows tools\nIn Windows, the `PsSuspend` command line utility from the SysInternals Suite provides functionality to suspend processes on a local or remote system."
