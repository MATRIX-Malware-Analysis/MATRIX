    "x_kb_abstract": "A system and process for addressing computer security vulnerabilities. The system and process generally comprise aggregating vulnerability information on a plurality of computer vulnerabilities; constructing a remediation database of said plurality of computer vulnerabilities; constructing a remediation signature to address the computer vulnerabilities; and deploying said remediation signature to a client computer. The remediation signature essentially comprises a sequence of actions to address a corresponding vulnerability. A managed automated approach to the process is contemplated in which the system is capable of selective deployment of remediation signatures; selective resolution of vulnerabilities; scheduled deployment of remediation signatures; and scheduled scanning of client computers for vulnerabilities.",
