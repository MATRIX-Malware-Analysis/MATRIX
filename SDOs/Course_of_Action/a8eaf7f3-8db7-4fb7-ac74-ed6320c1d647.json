    "x_kb_mitre_analysis": "This patent describes techniques for detecting insider attacks. Network packet capture data is collected and stored for processing. Metadata is extracted for each communication session on the organization's network and includes information on source and destination host destination port, number of connection attempts, size of data exchanged, duration and time of the communication. The metadata is used to build a connectivity graph of the network and identify groups of similar hosts that exhibit similar behavior. For each group of similar behavior identified, a baseline behavior pattern profile is developed. Network activity for a host within a group that deviates over a threshold from the baseline behavior patterns is identified as suspicious and an alert is generated.",
