    "description": "A bootloader is software that is responsible for booting a computer. When a computer is turned off, its software\u200d-\u200cincluding operating systems, application code, and data\u200d-\u200cremains stored on non-volatile memory. When the computer is powered on, it typically does not have an operating system or its loader in random-access memory (RAM). The computer first executes a relatively small program stored in read-only memory (ROM, and later EEPROM, NOR flash) along with some needed data, to initialize RAM (especially on x86 systems) to access the nonvolatile device (usually block device, eg NAND flash) or devices from which the operating system programs and data can be loaded into RAM."
