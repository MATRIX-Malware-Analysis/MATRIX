    "x_kb_abstract": "A system and method for providing an actively invalidated client-side network resource cache are disclosed. A particular embodiment includes: a client configured to request, for a client application, data associated with an identifier from a server; the server configured to provide the data associated with the identifier and to establish a queue associated with the identifier at a scalable message queuing system, the client being configured to subscribe to the queue at the scalable message queuing system to receive invalidation information associated with the data; the server being further configured to signal the queue of an invalidation event associated with the data; the scalable message queuing system being configured to convey information indicative of the invalidation event to the client; and the client being further configured to re-request the data associated with the identifier from the server upon receipt of the information indicative of the invalidation event.",
