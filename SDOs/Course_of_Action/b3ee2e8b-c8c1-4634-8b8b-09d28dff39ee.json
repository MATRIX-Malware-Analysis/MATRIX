    "x_kb_abstract": "In an attempt to avoid detection after compromising a machine, threat actors often try to disable Windows Defender. This is often done using \u201csc\u201d [service control], a legitimate tool provided by Microsoft for managing services. This action interferes with event detection and may lead to a security event going undetected, thereby potentially leading to further compromise of the network.",
