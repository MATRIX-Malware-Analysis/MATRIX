    "x_kb_mitre_analysis": "This patent describes a technique for detecting man-in-the-browser attacks. Current user session data is compared with the average user session that is based on collected data representing average values across all user sessions over a data-collection period. User session data includes average time between clicks and the order in which website pages are viewed. The comparisons are combined to generate a score that indicates the likelihood that the current session is a man-in-the-browser attack.",
