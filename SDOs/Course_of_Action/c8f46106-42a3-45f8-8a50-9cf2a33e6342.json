    "x_kb_abstract": "Buffer overflow attacks continue to be a major security problem and detecting attacks of this nature\nis therefore crucial to network security. Signature based network based intrusion detection systems (NIDS)\ncompare network traffic to signatures modelling suspicious or attack traffic to detect network attacks. Since\ndetection is based on pattern matching, a signature modelling the attack must exist for the NIDS to detect it, and\nit is therefore only capable of detecting known attacks. This paper proposes a method to detect buffer overflow\nattacks by parsing the payload of network packets in search of shellcode which is the remotely executable\ncomponent of a buffer overflow attack. By analysing the shellcode it is possible to determine which system\ncalls the exploit uses, and hence the operation of the exploit. Current NIDS-based buffer overflow detection\ntechniques mainly rely upon specific signatures for each new attack. Our approach is able to detect previously\nunseen buffer overflow attacks, in addition to existing ones, without the need for specific signatures for each\nnew attack. The method has been implemented and tested for buffer overflow attacks on Linux on the Intel x86\narchitecture using the Snort NIDS.",
