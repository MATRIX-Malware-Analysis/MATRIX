The hash values are compared against precomputed hash values for the identified firmware. A hash value mismatch may indicate that the firmware may have been tampered with or updated with a non-current release indicating a misconfiguration for the system.\n\n## Considerations\n* Requires cryptographically computed hash values of firmware\n* Requires storage of precomputed firmware hash values"
