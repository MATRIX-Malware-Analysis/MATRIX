    "x_kb_abstract": "In one aspect, a method useful for preventing exploitation of a vulnerability in an interpreted code by monitoring and validating an execution of the interpreted code in a script file by an application server, includes the step of generating a mapping for an incoming network connection to a specified script file to be executed by an application server. The computerized method includes the step of inserting a hook for monitoring an application programming interface (API) call or a privileged instruction executed by the application server. The computerized method includes the step of inserting a validation code configured to validate the API call or the privileged instruction executed by the interpreted code in a script.",

    "x_kb_mitre_analysis": "This patent describes a technique for monitoring API calls. During execution of interpreted code the observed API calls are validated against a whitelist of API calls for that interpreted code file. Action is taken if the observed API call is not in accordance with the list.",
