An application may attempt to use the cached credential for a connection. If the cached credentials exist then the user will not be typically prompted for new credentials.\n\n\n## Considerations\nAre these cached credentials only on the local host? Can they be persisted to the remote server?\n\n## Examples\nWindows Credential Management API"
