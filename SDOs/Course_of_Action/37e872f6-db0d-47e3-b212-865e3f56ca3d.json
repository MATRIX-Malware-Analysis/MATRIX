    "x_kb_article": "## How it works\n\nA regular expression (shortened as regex or regexp) is a sequence of characters that specifies a match pattern in text. Usually such patterns are used by string-searching algorithms for \"find\" or \"find and replace\" operations on strings, or for input validation.\n\n## Key Test Considerations\n\n- **External review of regular expressions**: Regular expressions used in rules should be reviewed by a independent developer SME.  Regex testing and visualization tools may be used to aid this review.  Back-tests for failure modes identified during the review shoud be developed.  Regular expressions are easy to get wrong and may appear to work on limited tests; small mistakes can lead to unintended misses and matches.]\n\n- **Processing Performance Review**: Review of resource-intensive rules may be necessary if system performance degraded.  Look for cases of \u201cexponential backtracking\u201d  Some regexes are computationally expensive.\n\n## References\n1. Regular expression. (2023, June 1). In _Wikipedia_.
