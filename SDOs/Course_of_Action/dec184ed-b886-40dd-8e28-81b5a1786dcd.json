    "description": "Metadata is \"data [information] that provides information about other data\". Three distinct types of metadata exist: structural metadata, descriptive metadata, and administrative metadata. Structural metadata is data about the containers of data. For instance a \"book\" contains data, and data about the book is metadata about that container of data. Descriptive metadata uses individual instances of application data or the data content."
