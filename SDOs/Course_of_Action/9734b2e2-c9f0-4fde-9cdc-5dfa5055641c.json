    "description": "Collaborative software or groupware is application software designed to help people working on a common task to attain their goals. One of the earliest definitions of groupware is \"intentional group processes plus software to support them\". Collaborative software is a broad concept that overlaps considerably with computer-supported cooperative work (CSCW). According to Carstensen and Schmidt (1999) groupware is part of CSCW. The authors claim that CSCW, and thereby groupware, addresses \"how collaborative activities and their coordination can be supported by means of computer systems.\""
