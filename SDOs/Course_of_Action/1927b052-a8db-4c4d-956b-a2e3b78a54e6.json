    "x_kb_article": "## How it works\nA detection analytic is developed to determine when a user uses decoy credentials. Subsequent actions by that user may be monitored or controlled by the defender.\n\nA credential may be:\n * Domain username and password\n * Local system username and password\n\n## Considerations\n* Decoy credentials should be integrated with a larger decoy environment to ensure that when decoy credentials are compromised, the credentials are used to interact with a decoy asset that is being monitored.\n* Continuous maintenance and updates are needed to ensure the legitimacy of the larger decoy environment and specifically the assets that utilize the decoy credentials."
