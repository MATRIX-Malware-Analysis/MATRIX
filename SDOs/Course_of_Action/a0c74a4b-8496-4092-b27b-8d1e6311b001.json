The media may include URLs, points of contact, or other identifiers to entice interaction from adversaries.\n\n## Considerations\n* Information used in decoy public released media must contain enough realism to deceive and provide interaction from adversaries.\n* Continuous development, creation, and distribution of media and identifiers are needed to ensure adversary interaction continues over time.\n* Decoy public releases could be placed on platforms with different degrees of ownership, including entirely enterprise-owned infrastructure, IaaS, and SaaS (including social applications). Platforms that are not entirely enterprise-owned may be more likely to gather information"
