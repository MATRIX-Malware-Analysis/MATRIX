    "description": "A network of multiple, connected networks. Internetworking is the practice of connecting a computer network with other networks through the use of gateways that provide a common method of routing information packets between the networks. The resulting system of interconnected networks are called an internetwork, or simply an internet. Internetworking is a combination of the words inter (\"between\") and networking; not internet-working or international-network."
