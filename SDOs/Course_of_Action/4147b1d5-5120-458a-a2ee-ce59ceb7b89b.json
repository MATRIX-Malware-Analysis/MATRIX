    "description": "For most file systems, a program initializes access to a file in a file system using the open system call. This allocates resources associated to the file (the file descriptor), and returns a handle that the process will use to refer to that file. In some cases the open is performed by the first access. During the open, the filesystem may allocate memory for buffers, or it may wait until the first operation. Various other errors which may occur during the open include directory update failures, un-permitted multiple connections, media failures, communication link failures and device failures."
