    "description": "In computing, a server is a piece of computer hardware or software (computer program) that provides functionality for other programs or devices, called \"clients\". This architecture is called the client-server model. Servers can provide various functionalities, often called \"services\", such as sharing data or resources among multiple clients, or performing computation for a client. A single server can serve multiple clients, and a single client can use multiple servers. A client process may run on the same device or may connect over a network to a server on a different device. Typical servers are database servers, file servers, mail servers, print servers, web servers, game servers, and application servers."
