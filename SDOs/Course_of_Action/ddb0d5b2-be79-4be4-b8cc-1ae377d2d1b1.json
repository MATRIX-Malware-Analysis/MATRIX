Security software or users themselves may detect malicious or suspicious email in a local or remote mail folder email and then employ this technique.\n\n## Considerations\n\nFor email that needs to be removed, an infosec organization may choose to take additional follow-up actions (such as blocking the sources or notifying providers), rather than only relying on email deletion.\n\nFor the case where users detect likely suspicious email files, the organization should consider implementing a means for reporting these emails to their infosec organization.\n\nEmail files may propagate through many storage systems across the an organization's systems over time, so early detection and blocking helps avoid residual, latent stores of malicous email content in the enterprise.",
