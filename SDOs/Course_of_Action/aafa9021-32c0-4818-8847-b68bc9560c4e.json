    "x_kb_article": "## How it works\nProfiling request and response payloads across multiple clients to a single server to develop a baseline of their characteristics. May take into account request/response sizes, entropy, frequency, and rhythm. Finally, identify outliers as they may indicate a malicious payload delivery and subsequent server exploitation.\n\n\n## Considerations\n* Collecting metrics to establish a profile can be challenging since user behavior can change easily.\n* Employees may work different hours or inconsistent schedules which will cause false positives.\n* Collection of network activity to generate metrics is a computationally intensive process.\n* Users may log into different workstations which may cause false positives."
