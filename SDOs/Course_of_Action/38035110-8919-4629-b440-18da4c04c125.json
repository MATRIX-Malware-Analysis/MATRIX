    "x_kb_article": "## How it works\n\nDirect Physical Link Mapping involves a manual process where a network engineer or administrator physically observes and documents the physical connections within the network infrastructure.\n\n## Considerations\n\n* Constructing and maintaining physical topologies for extensive networks can be challenging and time-consuming using manual methods. Therefore, where feasible, automated methods like active physical link mapping should be considered as a partial or complete solution for physical link mapping processes.\n\n* In scenarios where active physical link mapping is not an option, physical inspection of networks is necessary to accomplish physical link mapping. This is due to the lack of reliable techniques to accurately map physical links solely through passive network traffic monitoring.",
