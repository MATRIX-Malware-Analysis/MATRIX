    "x_kb_abstract": "The present disclosure is directed to a system, method, and computer program for detecting and assessing security risks in an enterprise's computer network. A behavior model is built for a user in the network based on the user's interactions with the network, wherein a behavior model for a user indicates client device(s), server(s), and resources used by the user. The user's behavior during a period of time is compared to the user's behavior model. A risk assessment is calculated for the period of time based at least in part on the comparison between the user's behavior and the user's behavior model, wherein any one of certain anomalies between the user's behavior and the user's behavior model increase the risk assessment.",

    "x_kb_mitre_analysis": "This patent describes calculating a risk score to detect anomalies in user activity based on comparing a user's current session with a user behavior model. The user behavior model is comprised of a number of histograms including:\n\n* client devices from which the user logs in\n* servers accessed\n* data accessed\n* applications accessed\n* session duration\n* logon time of day\n* logon day of week\n* geo - location of logon origination\n\nThe system has an initial training period with x number of days (e. g., 90 days) in which session data is recorded in behavior models before behavior analysis begins.The histograms are then used to determine anomalies between current session activity and a user's behavior model. Values for a histogram category are along one axis and the number of times the value is received for the category is along another axis. If a data point value associated with the current user session is over an anomaly threshold, an alert is generated.",
