    "x_kb_abstract": "A service proxy is described herein. The service proxy is configured to act as an intermediary between a client and a service. The service proxy may observe communications, modify communications, log communications, or the like, particularly so as to enhance the security and reliability of the host device. In some implementations, the service proxy may cooperate with an operating system to take over a named port object. In some implementations, the service proxy may receive messages as an intermediary between the client and the server. In some implementations, the service proxy may attach to a shared memory to intercept communications. In some implementations, the service proxy may be injected into a client process to appear to be the client itself.",
