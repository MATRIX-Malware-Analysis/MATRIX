    "x_kb_abstract": "Embodiments of the present invention are directed to a method and system for automated risk analysis. The method includes accessing host configuration information of a host and querying a vulnerability database based on the host configuration information. The method further includes receiving a list of vulnerabilities and accessing a plurality of vulnerability scores. The list of vulnerabilities corresponds to vulnerabilities of the host. Vulnerabilities can be removed from the list based on checking for installed fixes corresponding to vulnerability. A composite risk score can then be determined for the host a nd each software product of the host based on the plurality of vulnerability scores. An aggregate risk score can then be determined for the host and each software product of the host based on the plurality of vulnerability scores.",
