    "description": "An authentication server provides a network service that applications use to authenticate the credentials, usually account names and passwords, of their users. When a client submits a valid set of credentials, it receives a cryptographic ticket that it can subsequently use to access various services. Major authentication algorithms include passwords, Kerberos, and public key encryption."
