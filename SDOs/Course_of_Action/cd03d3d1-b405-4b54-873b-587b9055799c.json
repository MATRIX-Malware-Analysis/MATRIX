    "x_kb_abstract": "Fuzzy OCR to detect domain name homoglyph attacks.\n\nVarious embodiments of the invention disclosed herein provide techniques for detecting a homograph attack. An IDN collision detection server retrieves a first domain name that includes a punycode element. The IDN collision detection server converts the first domain into a second domain name that includes a Unicode character corresponding to the punycode element. The IDN collision detection server converts the second domain name into an image. The IDN collision detection server performs one or more optical character recognition operations on the image to generate a textual string associated with the image. The IDN collision detection server determines that the textual string matches at least a portion of a third domain name.",
