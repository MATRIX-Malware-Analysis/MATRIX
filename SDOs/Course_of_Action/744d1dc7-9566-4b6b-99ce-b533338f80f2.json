    "x_kb_article": "## How it works\nAnswer set programming (ASP) is oriented towards difficult (primarily NP-hard) search problems. The computational process employed in the design of many answer set solvers is an enhancement of the DPLL algorithm and, in principle, it always terminates (unlike Prolog query evaluation, which may lead to an infinite loop).\n\nIn a more general sense, ASP includes all applications of answer sets to knowledge representation and the use of Prolog-style query evaluation for solving problems arising in these applications.\n\n## References\n1.
