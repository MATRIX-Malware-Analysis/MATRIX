    "x_kb_article": "## How it works\nA basic example of string searching is when the pattern and the searched text are arrays of elements of an alphabet (finite set) \u03a3. \u03a3 may be a human language alphabet, for example, the letters A through Z and other applications may use a binary alphabet (\u03a3 = {0,1}) or a DNA alphabet (\u03a3 = {A,C,G,T}) in bioinformatics.\n\nIn practice, the method of feasible string-search algorithm may be affected by the string encoding. In particular, if a variable-width encoding is in use, then it may be slower to find the Nth character, perhaps requiring time proportional to N. This may significantly slow some search algorithms. One of many possible solutions is to search for the sequence of code units instead, but doing so may produce false matches unless the encoding is specifically designed to avoid it.\n\n## References\n1.
