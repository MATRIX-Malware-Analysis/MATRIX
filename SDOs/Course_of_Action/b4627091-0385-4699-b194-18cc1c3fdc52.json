    "x_kb_abstract": "This paper describes a hierarchical graph-based model that captures mission dependencies at various levels of abstraction, showing interdependencies among mission objectives, tasks, information, and cyber assets. For this work, we employ established tools within a structured methodology for cyber resiliency analysis. Our model is focused on a strategic-level military scenario defined in a formal Request for Information (RFI) to industry and research partners by the NATO Multinational Cyber Defense Capability Development (MN CD2) Work Package 2 (WP2). We enhance this scenario with additional mission and operational context, and then build a mission dependency model for the enhanced scenario. It is anticipated that our mission dependency model will be part of an upcoming demonstration of cyber defense situational awareness capabilities in a NATO Communications and Information (NCI) Agency test environment, integrated with data sources that represent the operational military environment.",
