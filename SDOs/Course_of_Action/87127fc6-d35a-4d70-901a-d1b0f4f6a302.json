    "x_kb_abstract": "Hierarchical threat intelligence embedded in subdomain CNAMEs of a DNS denylist.\n\nIn one embodiment, a response policy zone (RPZ) application generates an RPZ that includes contexts for the on-line threats that are associated with domain names. For a domain name that is associated with an on-line threat, the RPZ application determines a threat specification that describes a characteristic of the on-line threat. The RPZ application then generates an alias based on the domain name and the threat specification. Subsequently, the RPZ application generates a domain name system (DNS) resource record that maps the domain name to the alias, includes the resource record in the RPZ, and transmits the RPZ to a DNS name server that implements the RPZ. Upon receiving a DNS query associated with the domain name, the DNS name server generates a DNS response based on the alias. Because the domain name and the threat specification is reflected in the alias, the DNS response automatically provides a relevant context.",
