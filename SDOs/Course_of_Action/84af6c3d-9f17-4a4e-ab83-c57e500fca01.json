    "x_kb_abstract": "Organizations risk losing revenue, customers, and reputation, and exposing internal or customer data to\nattackers if they do not properly manage Transport Layer Security (TLS) server certificates. TLS is the\nmost widely used security protocol to secure web transactions and other communications on the\ninternet and internal networks. TLS server certificates are central to the security and operation of\ninternet-facing and internal web services. Improper TLS server certificate management results in\nsignificant outages to web applications and services-such as government services, online banking, flight operations, and mission-critical services within an organization-and increased risk of security breaches.",
