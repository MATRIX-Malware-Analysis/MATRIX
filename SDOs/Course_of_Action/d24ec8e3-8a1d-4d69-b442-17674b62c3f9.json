    "x_kb_abstract": "Adversaries may find it necessary to use Dyanamic-link Libraries (DLLs) to evade defenses. One way these DLLs can be \"executed\" is through the use of the built-in Windows utility RunDLL32, which allows a user to execute code in a DLL, providing the name and optional arguments to an exported entry point. Windows uses RunDll32 legitimately in its normal operation, but with a proper baseline and understanding of the environment, monitoring its usage could be fruitful.",
