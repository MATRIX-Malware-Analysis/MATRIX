    "description": "Centroid-based clustering organizes the data into non-hierarchical clusters, in contrast to hierarchical clustering defined below. K-means is the most widely-used centroid-based clustering algorithm. Centroid-based algorithms are efficient but sensitive to initial conditions and outliers.",
