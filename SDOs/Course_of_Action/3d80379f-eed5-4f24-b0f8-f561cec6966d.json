    "description": "A process spawn refers to a function that loads and executes a new child process.The current process may wait for the child to terminate or may continue to execute asynchronously. Creating a new subprocess requires enough memory in which both the child process and the current program can execute. There is a family of spawn functions in DOS, inherited by Microsoft Windows. There is also a different family of spawn functions in an optional extension of the POSIX standards.  Fork-exec is another technique combining two Unix system calls, which can effect a process spawn."
