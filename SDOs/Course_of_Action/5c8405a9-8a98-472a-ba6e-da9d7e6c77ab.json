    "description": "In a computer supporting virtual memory, the term\u00a0physical address\u00a0is used mostly to differentiate from a\u00a0virtual address. In particular, in computers utilizing a\u00a0memory management unit(MMU) to translate memory addresses, the virtual and physical addresses refer to an address before and after translation performed by the MMU, respectively."
