    "x_kb_abstract": "Once security and privacy controls are implemented, they need to be evaluated for correctness and effectiveness. After the initial assessment is completed and the system enters the operations/maintenance phase of the system development life cycle, the controls are assessed on an ongoing basis according to the organization and system\u2019s continuous monitoring plans. The ongoing assessment supports the authorizing official\u2019s decision to continue or discontinue the system\u2019s authorization to operate. Control effectiveness assessments are performed by an independent third-party assessor or assessment team if the system categorization is moderate or high.",
