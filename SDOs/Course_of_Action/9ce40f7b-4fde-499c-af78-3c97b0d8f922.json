    "x_kb_abstract": "System and method is disclosed for protecting client software running on a client computer from tampering using a secure server. Prior to or independent of executing the client software, the system integrates self-protection into the client software; removes functions from the client software for execution on the server; develops client software self-protection updates; and periodically distributes the updates. During execution of the client software, the system receives an initial request from the client computer for execution of the removed function; verifies the initial request; and cooperates with the client computer in execution of the client software if verification is successful. If verification is unsuccessful, the system can attempt to update the client software on the client computer; and require a new initial request. Client software can be updated on occurrence of a triggering event. Communications can be encrypted, and the encryption updated. Authenticating checksums can be used for verification.",
