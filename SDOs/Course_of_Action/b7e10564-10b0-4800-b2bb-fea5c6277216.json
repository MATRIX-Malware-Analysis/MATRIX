    "x_kb_abstract": "Methods, systems and machine-readable media for authenticating an end user for a client application are disclosed. According to one embodiment of the invention, a method of authenticating an end user for a client application using a directory service having an authentication control policy that tracks failed authentication attempts and allows lock out of an account after a predetermined number of failures comprises receiving end user identity information and security information at the client application; sending a search request to the directory service for an entry associated with the end user identity information and, if a match is found, receiving a authentication token from the directory service associated with the end user identity information; comparing the received authentication token with the security information; if the authentication token matches the security information, sending a request to update the directory service to indicate that successful authentication of the end user has occurred; and if the authentication token does not match the security information, sending a request to update the directory service to indicate that a failed attempt at authentication of the end user has occurred.",
