    "x_kb_abstract": "An approach for detecting network threats is disclosed, that may involve receiving network traffic, plotting the network traffic in a n-dimensional feature space to form a network map, generating a client signature at least by placing new client points in the map, setting a threshold, and generating an alarm if one or more client activity points exceed the threshold. In some embodiments, the network map and the client signature are updated using sliding windows and distance calculations.",

    "x_kb_mitre_analysis": "This patent describes detecting network threats by first passively collecting network traffic and storing it for processing. The stored network traffic data is used to map network events to create a cluster map. Events are network activity associated with clients, servers, or control modules such as a Kerberos Domain Controller (KDC); account information; services accessed by the client; or the number of times a service is accessed. Events that exceed a threshold from a center of gravity point of a cluster are identified as suspicious activity and an alert is generated.",
