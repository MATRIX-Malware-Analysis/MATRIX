    "x_kb_abstract": "Certutil.exe may download a file from a remote destination using -urlcache. This behavior does require a URL to be passed on the command-line. In addition, -f (force) and -split (Split embedded ASN.1 elements, and save to files) will be used. It is not entirely common for certutil.exe to contact public IP space. However, it is uncommon for certutil.exe to write files to world writeable paths.\\ During triage, capture any files on disk and review. Review the reputation of the remote IP or domain in question.",
