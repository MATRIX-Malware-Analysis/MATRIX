    "x_kb_article": "## How it works\nSystem service applications may originate from the operating system installation or third-party applications installed with administrative privileges. These services have an entry point of some executable file-- a binary or a script. Attackers sometimes modify these executables to launch their own code. Analyzing changes in these files may uncover unauthorized activity.\n\n## Considerations\n* These files change for legitimate reasons when the system or software updates.\n* The source of truth must not be corrupted in order for this method to work."
