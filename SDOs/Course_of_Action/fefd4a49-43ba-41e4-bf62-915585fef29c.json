    "x_kb_abstract": "Methods and systems are disclosed for selecting text character strings from a corpus of relevant strings that would commonly be considered to be visually similar to human viewer to an input string. The initial corpus may be any sufficiently broad or specific source of text, e.g., the names of users in a computer application system. The character strings in the corpus are classified such that direct, character-by-character comparisons may be limited to a small subset of likely-similar strings. The input string is then directly compared to strings that are likely to be similar to it, taking into account individual characters' similarities, combinations of characters that look similar to individual characters, transposition of characters, and simple additions and deletions.",

    "x_kb_mitre_analysis": "Text input is compared to an engine of look-alike sets of text characters. An estimate of similar characters based on the engine is conducted, and an alert is triggered if the estimated similarity is lower than a given threshold.",
