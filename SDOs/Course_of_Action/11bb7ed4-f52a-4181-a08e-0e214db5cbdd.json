    "description": "x injects y: The subject x takes the action of exploiting a security flaw by introducing (injecting) y, which is code or data that will change the course of execution or state of a computing process to an alternate course or state. Typically code injection is associated with adversaries intending the alternate course to facilitate a malevolent purpose; however, code injection can be unintentional or the intentions behind it may be good or benign."
