    "x_kb_abstract": "A method and apparatus for utilizing a token which is preferably a \"dumb token\" to provide secure access by authorized users to a selected resource. The token stores a secret user code in machine readable form, which code is read by a token processor. The token processor also receives a time-varying value and an algorithm, both of which may be stored or generated at either the token or the token processor and preferably a secret personal identification code which may be inputted at the token, but is preferably inputted at the token processor. The secret user code, time-varying value and secret personal identification code are then algorithmically combined by the algorithm, preferably in the token processor, to generate a one-time nonpredictable code which is transmitted to a host processor. The host processor utilizes the received one-time nonpredictable code to determine if the user is authorized access to the resource and grants access to the resource if the user is determined to be authorized. The system may be modified to operate in query/response mode. The token processor may be any of a variety of available portable remote processors or may be a device such as a telephone which is equipped with card or other token reader and with processing capability.",
