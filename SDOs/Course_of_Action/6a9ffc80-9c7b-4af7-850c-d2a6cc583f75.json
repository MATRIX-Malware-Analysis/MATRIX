The files may be configurations, documents, executables, or other file types.\n\n\n## Considerations\nProperties of the file such as cryptographic checksums, file creation date, file modified date, file size, file owner etc may be modified to improve the credibility of the file.\n\n## Example\n* A CSV file with decoy user credentials is placed on a system. The system or network is then monitored to detect any accesses to the decoy files."
