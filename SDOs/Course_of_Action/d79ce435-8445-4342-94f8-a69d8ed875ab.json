    "x_kb_abstract": "Email on the Internet can be forged in a number of ways. In particular, existing protocols place no restriction on what a sending host can use as the \"MAIL FROM\" of a message or the domain given on the SMTP HELO/EHLO commands.  This document describes version 1 of the Sender Policy Framework (SPF) protocol, whereby Administrative Management Domains (ADMDs) can explicitly authorize the hosts that are allowed to use their domain names, and a receiving host can check such authorization.",
