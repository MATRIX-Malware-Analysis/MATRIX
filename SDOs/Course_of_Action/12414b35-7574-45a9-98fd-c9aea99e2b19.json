    "description": "Cache memory is temporary storage that is more readily available to the processor than the computer's main memory source, located between the main memory and the processor.  It is typically either integrated directly into the CPU chip (level 1 cache) or placed on a separate chip with a bus interconnect with the CPU (level 2 cache)."
