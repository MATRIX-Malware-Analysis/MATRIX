    "x_kb_abstract": "In case you don't already know, FWTK stands for the FireW all Tool Kit. It is used as a base to create a secure firewall system. If you need good documentation, please read the source code. If you are not familiar with C or do not feel comfortable with performing the configuration and security verification yourself, then I would suggest that you purchase a commercial firewall from a vendor (such as TIS, Checkpoint, Raptor, etc.).\n\nA machine needs other tools to secure it, including, but hardly limited to, tools to check files (tripwire), audit tools (tiger/cops), secure access methods (kerberos/ssh), something to watch logs and machine states (swatch/watcher some to mind) and filtering and routing tools such as screend/ipfilterd/ipacl.\n\nAgain, I would recommend that you do not proceed to build a production FWTK firewall unless you are familiar with UNIX security.",
