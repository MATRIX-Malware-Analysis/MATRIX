    "x_kb_abstract": "The disclosed computer-implemented method for detecting credential theft may include (i) monitoring a secured computing system's credential store that may include at least one sensitive credential that may be used to facilitate authentication of a user that is attempting to access the secured computing system, (ii) gathering, while monitoring the credential store, primary evidence of an attempted theft of the sensitive credential from the credential store, (iii) gathering corroborating evidence of the attempted theft of the sensitive credential, and (iv) performing a security action in response to gathering the primary evidence and the corroborating evidence of the attempted theft. The primary evidence of the attempted theft of the sensitive credential may include evidence of any suspicious access of the sensitive credential from the credential store that occurs outside of a procedure of authenticating the user. Various other methods, systems, and computer-readable media are also disclosed.",
