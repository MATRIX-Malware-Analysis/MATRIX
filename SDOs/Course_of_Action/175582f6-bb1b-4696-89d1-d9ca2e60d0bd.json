    "x_kb_abstract": "SNMP, or Simple Network Management Protocol, is a protocol and a standard that is supported by just about any managed network-connected hardware. There are three widely deployed versions: SNMP v1, v2c (most commonly used), and v3. SNMP is typically utilized read-only, but supports read/write, and by default utilized port 161. SNMP exposes management data in the form of \u2018variables\u2019, which are organized in what is known as a MIB, or \u201cManagement Information Base\u201d. A MIB essentially describes the variables available on a given system, each of which can be remotely queried via SNMP.",
