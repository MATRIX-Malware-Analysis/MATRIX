    "description": "When performing unsupervised learning, the machine is presented with unlabeled data. (Unlabeled data has no target.) Unsupervised learning algorithms seek to discover intrinsic patterns that underlie the data, such as a clustering parameter or a redundant parameter (dimension) that can be reduced.",
