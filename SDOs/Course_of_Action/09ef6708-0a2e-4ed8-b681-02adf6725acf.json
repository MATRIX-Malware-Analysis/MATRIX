    "description": "An address space defines a range of discrete addresses, each of which may correspond to a network host, peripheral device, disk sector, a memory cell or other logical or physical entity. For software programs to save and retrieve stored data, each unit of data must have an address where it can be located. The number of address spaces available depends on the underlying address structure, which is usually limited by the computer architecture being used."
