    "x_kb_abstract": "A network security device performs a three-stage analysis of traffic to identify malicious clients. In one example, a device includes an attack detection module to, during a first stage, monitor network connections to a protected network device, during a second stage, to monitor a plurality of types of transactions for the plurality of network sessions when a parameter for the connections exceeds a connection threshold, and during a third stage, to monitor communications associated with network addresses from which transactions of the at least one of type of transactions originate when a parameter associated with the at least one type of transactions exceeds a transaction-type threshold. The device executes a programmed action with respect to at least one of the network addresses when the transactions of the at least one of the plurality of types of transactions originating from the at least one network address exceeds a client-transaction threshold.",
