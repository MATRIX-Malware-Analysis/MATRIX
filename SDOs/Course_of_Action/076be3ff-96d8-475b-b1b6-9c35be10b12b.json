This includes the associated email addresses, social media accounts, and other online communication profiles.\n\n## Considerations\n* Include phone numbers and online social profiles as well as automatically or manually responding to contact made to the persona to improve realism.\n* Continuous updating and managing the decoy personas and online activity streams to ensure personas do not become stale and outdated."
