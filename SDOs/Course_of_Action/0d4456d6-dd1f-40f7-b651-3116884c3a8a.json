    "x_kb_abstract": "A security agent implemented on a monitored computing device is described herein. The security agent is configured to detect an action of interest (AoI) that may be probative of a security exploit and to determine a context in which that AoI occurred. Based on that context, the security agent is further configured to decide whether the AoI is a security exploit and can take preventative action to prevent the exploit from being completed.\n\nDetermining that the AoI includes the security exploit is based at least in part on one or more of: determining that the return address is outside memory previously allocated for an object; determining that the object identifier is associated with a vulnerable object; determining that permissions of the memory region include two or more of read, write, and execute; or determining that the memory region is one page in length.\n\nDetermining that the return address is outside memory previously allocated for an object and the method further including treating code that the return address points to as malicious code.",
