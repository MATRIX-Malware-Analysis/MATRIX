    "x_kb_abstract": "In an attempt to clear traces after compromising a machine, threat actors often try to clear Windows Event logs. This is often done using \u201cwevtutil\u201d, a legitimate tool provided by Microsoft. This action interferes with event collection and notification, and may lead to a security event going undetected, thereby potentially leading to further compromise of the network.",
