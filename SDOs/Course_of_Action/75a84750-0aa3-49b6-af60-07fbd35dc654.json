    "description": "A command-line interface or command language interpreter (CLI), also known as command-line user interface, console user interface, and character user interface (CUI), is a means of interacting with a computer program where the user (or client) issues commands to the program in the form of successive lines of text (command lines). Command-line interfaces to computer operating systems are less widely used by casual computer users, who favor graphical user interfaces. Programs with command-line interfaces are generally easier to automate via scripting."
