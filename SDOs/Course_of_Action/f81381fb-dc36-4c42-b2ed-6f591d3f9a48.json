    "x_kb_abstract": "Provided are devices, computer-program products, and methods (e.g., methods implemented by a production system or security agent program or process) for providing services on a production system to mimic a deception mechanism. For example, a method can include determining a deception characteristic of a deception mechanism and determining a production characteristic of the production system. The method can further include determining an additional service or a modification of an existing service of the production system using the deception characteristic and the production characteristic. In some cases, the additional service and/or the modification can be a deterrent to potential attackers of the production system. The method can further include modifying the production system to mimic the deception mechanism, including adding the additional service to the production system or modifying the existing service using the modification.",
