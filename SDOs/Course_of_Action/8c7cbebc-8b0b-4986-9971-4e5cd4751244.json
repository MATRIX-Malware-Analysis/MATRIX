    "x_kb_abstract": "A method and system for automatic termination of unauthorized malevolent processes operating on an information handling system. A list of authenticated and essential process list is stored on the information handling system. Unauthorized processes not contained on the list can be automatically terminated by the user by invoking the present invention with a single click of a mouse or pointer device on an icon residing on the display screen of the information handling system. The offending processes are immediately terminated without generating a user prompt, which would ordinarily provide sufficient time for the malware to spawn additional offending processes. The present invention also provides significant means to recover control of a malware-infected information handling system in order to use repair tools and utilities. The present invention can be deployed at the time of manufacture of an information handling system or independently installed by a user.",
