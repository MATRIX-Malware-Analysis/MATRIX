    "x_kb_abstract": "An anti-tamper system is disclosed that includes self-adjusting guards inserted in software. Self-adjusting guards include invocation criteria and guard function. During run-time, each time the self-adjusting guard is invoked, the invocation criteria is evaluated and the guard function is only executed if the invocation criteria is satisfied. The invocation criteria can be static or dynamic, satisfied randomly with fixed or varying probability, a monotonically or exponentially decreasing function or most any other type of function. The invocation criteria can be satisfied based on elapsed inter-guard invocation time (time since last guard function execution), target inter-guard invocation time, and/or guard execution time. A method is disclosed of inserting self-adjusting guards into software, and executing the software. Evaluating the invocation criteria can include adjusting the invocation criteria when satisfied. The self-adjusting guards can be inserted into the software at a source or object code level.",
