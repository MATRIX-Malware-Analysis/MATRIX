A denylist is maintained that contains DNS names and corresponding subdomains, including wildcards, that should be blocked for a given lookup.\n\n## Considerations\n* The denylist of domain names will have to be maintained and will need to be kept up to date\n* Other domains that resolve to the domain of interest for blocking (CNAME, etc).\n* Denylists should have identified maintenance cycles to ensure lists are not stale.",
