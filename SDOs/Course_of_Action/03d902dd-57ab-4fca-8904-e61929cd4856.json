    "description": "A code repository is a form of database where code, typically source code, is stored and managed.  In revision control systems, a repository is a data structure that stores metadata for a set of files or directory structure. Depending on whether the version control system in use is distributed like (Git or Mercurial) or centralized like (Subversion, CVS, or Perforce), the whole set of information in the repository may be duplicated on every user's system or may be maintained on a single server."
