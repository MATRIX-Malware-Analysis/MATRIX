    "description": "Fast symbolic links, allow storage of the target path within the data structures used for storing file information on disk (e.g., within the inodes). This space normally stores a list of disk block addresses allocated to a file. Thus, symlinks with short target paths are accessed quickly. Systems with fast symlinks often fall back to using the original method if the target path exceeds the available inode space."
