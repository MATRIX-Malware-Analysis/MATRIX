    "x_kb_article": "## How it works\nThis technique analyzes a user's resource accesses by comparing the user's recent activity against a baseline activity model. Major differences between the current activity and the baseline model might indicate unauthorized activity if they are severe enough.\n\n\n## Considerations\n* Potential for false positives from anomalies that are not associated with malicious activity.\n* Attackers that move low and slow may not differentiate their resource access activity behavior enough to trigger an alert."
