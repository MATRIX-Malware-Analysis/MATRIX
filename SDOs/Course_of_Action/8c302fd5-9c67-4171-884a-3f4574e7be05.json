    "description": "In computing, a network printer is a device that can be accessed over a network which makes a persistent representation of graphics or text, usually on paper. While most output is human-readable, bar code printers are an example of an expanded use for printers. The different types of printers include 3D printer, inkjet printer, laser printer, thermal printer, etc.  Note that not all printers are networked and the digital information to be printed must be passed either by removable media or as directly connecting the printer to a computer (e.g., by USB.)"
