    "description": "In Unix-like computer operating systems, a pipeline is a mechanism for inter-process communication using message passing.  In the strictest sense, a pipe is a single segment of a pipeline, allowing one process to pass information forward to another.  Network pipes allow processes on different hosts to interact."
