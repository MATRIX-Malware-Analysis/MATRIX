    "description": "A radio modem provides the means to send digital data wirelessly.  Radio modems are used to communicate by direct broadcast satellite, WiFi, WiMax, mobile phones, GPS, Bluetooth and NFC. Modern telecommunications and data networks also make extensive use of radio modems where long distance data links are required. Such systems are an important part of the PSTN, and are also in common use for high-speed computer network links to outlying areas where fiber optic is not economical."
