    "x_kb_abstract": "At early stages of Internet development, users were only able to register or access domains with ASCII characters. The introduction of IDN (Internationalized Domain Name) which uses the larger Unicode character set, made it possible for regional users to deal with domain names using their local language alphabet. Beside the advantages provided by IDN, a new type of network threats has also emerged. The reason behind this is that there are many similar-looking characters in Unicode system, called homoglyphs. These characters could be used by an attacker to lure users by replacing one or more characters of a benign domain.",
