    "description": "Windows Registry Keys are container objects similar to folders that contain subkeys and/or data entries called values. A key can be a 'Registry Hive' when it is root key of a logical group of keys, subkeys, and values that has a set of supporting files loaded into memory when the operating system is started or a user logs in."
