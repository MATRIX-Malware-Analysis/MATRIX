    "x_kb_abstract": "The method and apparatus for increasing the speed at which computer viruses are detected stores initial state information concerning the file or volume which is being examined for a virus. This information is stored in a cache in a non-volatile storage medium and when files are subsequently scanned for viruses, the current state information is compared to the initial state information stored in the cache. If the initial state information differs from the current state information then the file or volume is scanned for viruses which change the state information of the file or volume. If the initial state information and current state information is the same then the file or volume is scanned for a subset of viruses which do not change the state information.",
