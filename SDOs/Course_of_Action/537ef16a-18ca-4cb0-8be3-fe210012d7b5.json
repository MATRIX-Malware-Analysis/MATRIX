    "x_kb_article": "## How it works\nDetecting unauthorized user sessions by comparing the duration of a user logon session with a baseline behavior model. The behavior model comprises historical user session duration times.  Abnormalities between session duration and the behavior model may indicate suspicious activity.\n\n## Considerations\n* Potential for false positives from anomalies that are not associated with malicious activity.\n* Attackers may not differentiate their session duration enough to trigger an alert."
