The device management system provides for recognizing a newly added component, and determining if the newly added component is already a part of the system inventory. The newly added component is matched with a component currently on the system, based on at least one matching attribute. A point total is calculated for each match level and a final match score is provided. The match score is compared with an aggressiveness level to determine if a match does indeed exist.",
