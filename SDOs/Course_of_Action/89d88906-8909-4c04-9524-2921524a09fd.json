    "x_kb_abstract": "The example implementation demonstrates the ability to perform passive inspection of encrypted TLS connections. The question of whether or not to perform such an inspection is complex. There are important tradeoffs between traffic security and traffic visibility that each organization should consider. Some organizations prefer to decrypt internal TLS traffic, so it can be inspected to detect attacks that may be hiding within encrypted connections. Such inspection can detect intrusion, malware, and fraud, and can conduct troubleshooting, forensics, and performance monitoring. For these organizations, TLS inspection may serve as both a standard practice and a critical component of their threat detection and service assurance strategies.",
