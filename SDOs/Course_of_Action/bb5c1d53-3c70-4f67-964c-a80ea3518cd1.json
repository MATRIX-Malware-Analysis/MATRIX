    "x_kb_abstract": "Example techniques described herein determine a signature or classification of a data stream such as a file. The classification can indicate whether the data stream is associated with malware. A processor can locate training analysis regions of training data streams based on predetermined structure data, and determining training model inputs based on the training analysis regions. The processor can determine a computational model based on the training model inputs. The computational model can receive an input vector and provide a corresponding feature vector. The processor can then locate a trial analysis region of a trial data stream based on the predetermined structure data and determine a trial model input. The processor can operate the computational model based on the trial model input to provide a trial feature vector, e.g., a signature. The processor can operate a second computational model to provide a classification based on the signature.",

    "x_kb_mitre_analysis": "Provides a mechanism to classify files using file signatures based on a computational model. Training data that comprises at least a portion of a file, e.g. number of bytes, is used as input to the computational model to develop a file signature and classify the file as malware.",
