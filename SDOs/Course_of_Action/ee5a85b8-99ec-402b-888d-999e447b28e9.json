    "x_kb_article": "## How it works\nUsage of decoy session tokens may be monitored to track attacker behavior or otherwise control the beliefs of the attacker.\n\n## Considerations\n* Interaction and activity with the decoy session token must be constantly monitored and analyzed to detect unauthorized activity.\n* Session tokens are typically short-lived and therefore the decoy must be continuously updated to provide the appearance of it being used in the production environment.\n* Automated tools can assist with maintenance and updates by automatically adjusting the decoy session token and environment to mimic the production environment."
