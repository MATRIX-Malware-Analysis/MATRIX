    "x_kb_abstract": "The modernization of various critical infrastructure components has dictated the use of microprocessor-based\nembedded control systems in critical applications. It is often\ninfeasible, however, to employ the same level of security measures used in general purpose computing systems, due to the stringent\nperformance and resource constraints of embedded devices. Furthermore, as software relies on the firmware for proper operation,\nno software-level technique can detect malicious behavior of\nthe firmware. In this work, we propose ConFirm, a low-cost\ntechnique to detect malicious modifications in the firmware\nof embedded systems by measuring the number of low-level hardware events that occur during the execution of the firmware.",
