    "description": "A web server application (or web app) is an application software that runs on a web server, unlike computer-based software programs that are stored locally on the Operating System (OS) of the device. Web applications are accessed by the user through a web browser with an active internet connection. These applications are programmed using a client-server modeled structure-the user (\"client\") is provided services through an off-site server that is hosted by a third-party. Examples of commonly-used, web applications, include: web-mail, online retail sales, online banking, and online auctions."
