    "x_kb_article": "## How it Works\nA security agent installed on the host machine intercepts API calls between a process and operating system. Intercepted API calls are then compared against attack signatures/patterns to identify API calls that modify executable memory or modify the entry point address of a suspended child process. Attack patterns include:\n\n* Executable code of a suspended child process removed from memory by one or more API calls.\n* New executable code injected and / or loaded into memory of a suspended child process by one or more API calls.\n* Executable code modified by one or more API calls.\n* Next instruction pointer value in memory modified by one or more API calls.\n\n## Considerations\nComparing loaded code segments of processes with what is expected to have been loaded from a file can result in false positives, due to legitimate uses of self-modification for decrypting or uncompressing code segments."
