Examples of file access patterns include accessing a large number of files, accessing multiple file types, files being accessed located in multiple locations in a directory, and copying a file and encrypting the contents of that file into a copy.\n\n## Considerations\nCertain file access actions may not be statistically different from authorized activity."
