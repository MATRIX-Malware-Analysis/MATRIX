    "x_kb_article": "## How it works\nAuthentication event data is collected (logon information such as device id, time of day, day of week, geo-location, etc.) to create an activity baseline. Then, a threshold is determined either through a manually specified configuration, or a statistical analysis of deviations in historical data. New authentication events are evaluated to determine if a threshold is exceeded. Thresholds can be static or dynamic.\n\n### Actions\nAs a result of the analysis, actions taken could include:\n\n* [Account Locking](/technique/d3f:AccountLocking)\n* Raising an alert\n\n### Example data sources\n * Directory server logs\n * VPN Server logs\n * IDAM Capability logs\n * NAC logs\n * Authentication client logs\n * Kerberos network traffic\n * LDAP network traffic\n\n## Considerations\n\nThis technique covers statistical outliers. Though depending on the complexity or dimensionality of the data considered, outliers may not be obvious to a human analyst reviewing events in simplistic analytic views. If the malicious activity is not statistically different from benign activity, an alert threshold will not be met."
