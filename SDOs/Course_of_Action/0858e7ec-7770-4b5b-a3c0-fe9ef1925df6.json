    "description": "Homogeneous symmetric transformation takes both the source feature space Xs and target feature space Xt and learns feature transformations as to project each onto a common subspace Xc for adaptation purposes. This derived subspace becomes a domain-invariant feature subspace to associate cross-domain data, and in effect, reduces marginal distribution differences.",
