The hash values are compared against precomputed firmware hash values to determine if the firmware has been tampered with.\n\nWhen system firmware verification fails a set of predefined responses is typically invoked. The responses may direct the system to disable some devices or operations.\n\n## Considerations\n* Requires the use of system provided security modules\n* Secure hash values will need to be computed for firmware"
