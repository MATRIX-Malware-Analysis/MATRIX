    "x_kb_abstract": "A large number of embedded devices on the internet, such as\nrouters and VOIP phones, are typically ripe for exploitation. Little to no defensive technology, such as AV scanners or IDS's, are available to protect these devices. We propose a host-based defense mechanism, which we call Symbiotic Embedded Machines (SEM), that is specifically designed\nto inject intrusion detection functionality into the firmware of the device.",
