    "x_kb_abstract": "An SMB write can be an indicator of lateral movement, especially when combined with other information such as execution of that written file. Named pipes are a subset of SMB write requests. Named pipes such as msftewds may not be alarming; however others, such as lsarpc, may.\n\nMonitoring SMB write requests still creates some noise, particularly with named pipes. As a result, SMB is now split between writing named pipes and writing other files.",
