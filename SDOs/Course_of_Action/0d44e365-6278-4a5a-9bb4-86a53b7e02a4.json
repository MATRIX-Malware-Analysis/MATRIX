    "x_kb_abstract": "An access control list (ACL) consists of one or more access control entries (ACEs) that collectively define the network traffic profile. This profile can then be referenced by Cisco IOS XR Software software features such as traffic filtering, priority or custom queueing, and dynamic access control. Each ACL includes an action element (permit or deny) and a filter element based on criteria such as source address, destination address, protocol, and protocol-specific parameters.",
