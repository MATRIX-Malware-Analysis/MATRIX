    "x_kb_mitre_analysis": "The patent describes an insider threat detection system that analyzes packets sent within a network to identify and isolate malicious behavior. Current network traffic is collected and developed into a baseline that establishes the amount of data sent and received between a specific asset and a host. Current data transfer values are then compared with the baseline to identify anomalies.",
