    "description": "The Net utility is a component of the Windows operating system. It is used in command-line operations for control of users, groups, services, and network connections. [1]Net has a great deal of functionality, [2] much of which is useful for an adversary, such as gathering system and network information for Discovery, moving laterally through SMB/Windows Admin Shares using net use commands, and interacting with services. The net1.exe utility is executed for certain functionality when net.exe is run and can be used directly in commands such as net1 user.",
