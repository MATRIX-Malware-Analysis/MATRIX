    "description": "Sandboxes aren't used in the same manner as a typical user environment, so most of the time the screen resolution stays at the minimum 800x600 or lower. No one is actually working on a such small screen. Malware could potentially detect the screen resolution to determine if it's a user machine or a sandbox. This method is related to Unprotect technique U1315.",
