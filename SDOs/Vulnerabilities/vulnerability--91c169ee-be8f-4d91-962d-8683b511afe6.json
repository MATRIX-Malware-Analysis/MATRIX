    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Xiaomi Browser Prior to 10.4.0. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the handling of the miui.share application.
