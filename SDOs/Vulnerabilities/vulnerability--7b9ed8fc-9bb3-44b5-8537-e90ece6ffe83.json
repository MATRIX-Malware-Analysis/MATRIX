    "name": "Junos OS: Kernel crash (vmcore) upon receipt of a malformed IPv6 packet",
    "description": "An Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions vulnerability in the processing of a transit or directly received malformed IPv6 packet in Juniper Networks Junos OS results in a kernel crash, causing the device to restart, leading to a Denial of Service (DoS). Continued receipt and processing of this packet will create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition. This issue only affects systems with IPv6 configured. Devices with only IPv4 configured are not vulnerable to this issue. This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS: 19.4 versions prior to 19.4R3; 20.1 versions prior to 20.1R2; 20.2 versions prior to 20.2R1-S1, 20.2R2. This issue does not affect Juniper Networks Junos OS versions prior to 19.4R1.",
