    "description": "The Ultimate Member \u2013 User Profile, User Registration, Login & Membership Plugin WordPress plugin before 2.1.20 did not properly sanitise, validate or encode the query string when generating a link to edit user's own profile, leading to an authenticated reflected Cross-Site Scripting issue. Knowledge of the targeted username is required to exploit this, and attackers would then need to make the related logged in user open a malicious link.",
