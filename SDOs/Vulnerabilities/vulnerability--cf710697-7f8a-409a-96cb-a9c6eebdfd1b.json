    "description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business RV110W, RV130, RV130W, and RV215W Routers could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on an affected device.\r\n\r This vulnerability is due to improper validation of requests that are sent to the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted request to the web-based management interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code with root privileges on an affected device. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have valid Administrator credentials on the affected device.",
