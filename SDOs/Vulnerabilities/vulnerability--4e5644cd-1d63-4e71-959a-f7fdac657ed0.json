    "description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface\u00a0of EdgeConnect SD-WAN Orchestrator could allow an\u00a0unauthenticated remote attacker to run arbitrary commands on\u00a0the underlying host if certain preconditions outside of the\u00a0attacker's control are met. Successful exploitation of this\u00a0vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary\u00a0commands on the underlying operating system leading to\u00a0complete system compromise.",
