    "description": "Slack Morphism is a modern client library for Slack Web/Events API/Socket Mode and Block Kit. Debug logs expose sensitive URLs for Slack webhooks that contain private information. The problem is fixed in version 1.3.2 which redacts sensitive URLs for webhooks. As a workaround, people who use Slack webhooks may disable or filter debug logs.",
