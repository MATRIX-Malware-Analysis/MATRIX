    "description": "The AceIDE WordPress plugin through 2.6.2 does not sanitise or validate the user input which is appended to system paths before using it in various actions, such as to read arbitrary files from the server. This allows high privilege users such as administrator to access any file on the web server outside of the blog directory via a path traversal attack.",
