    "name": "Junos: QFX Series: Insufficient entropy on QFX3500 and QFX3600 platforms when the system boots up",
    "description": "On the QFX3500 and QFX3600 platforms, the number of bytes collected from the RANDOM_INTERRUPT entropy source when the device boots up is insufficient, possibly leading to weak or duplicate SSH keys or self-signed SSL/TLS certificates. Entropy increases after the system has been up and running for some time, but immediately after boot, the entropy is very low. This issue only affects the QFX3500 and QFX3600 switches. No other Juniper Networks products or platforms are affected by this weak entropy vulnerability.",
