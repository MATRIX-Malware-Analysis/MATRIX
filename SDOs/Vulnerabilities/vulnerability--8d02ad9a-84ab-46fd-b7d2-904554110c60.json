    "description": "The HTTP TRACK & TRACE methods were enabled in Kiwi Syslog Server 9.7.1 and earlier. These methods are intended for diagnostic purposes only. If enabled, the web server will respond to requests that use these methods by returning exact HTTP request that was received in the response to the client. This may lead to the disclosure of sensitive information such as internal authentication headers appended by reverse proxies.",
