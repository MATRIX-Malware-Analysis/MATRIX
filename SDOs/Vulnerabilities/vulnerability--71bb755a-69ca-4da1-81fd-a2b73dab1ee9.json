    "description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco SPA100 Series Analog Telephone Adapters (ATAs) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to view the contents of arbitrary files on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to improper input validation in the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted request to the web-based management interface of an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to retrieve the contents of arbitrary files on the device, possibly resulting in the disclosure of sensitive information.",
