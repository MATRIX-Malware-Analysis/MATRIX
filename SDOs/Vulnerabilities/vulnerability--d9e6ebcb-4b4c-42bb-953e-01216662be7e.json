    "description": "The Online Examination System Project 1.0 version is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks. An attacker can craft a malicious link that, when clicked by an admin user, will delete a user account from the database without the admin's consent. The email of the user to be deleted is passed as a parameter in the URL, which can be manipulated by the attacker. This could result in a loss of data.",
