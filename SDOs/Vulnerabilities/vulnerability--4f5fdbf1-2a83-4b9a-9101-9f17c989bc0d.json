    "name": "Buffer overflow due to unvalidated TCP data offset",
    "description": "Contiki-NG is an open-source, cross-platform operating system for internet of things devices. A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in Contiki-NG versions prior to 4.6. After establishing a TCP socket using the tcp-socket library, it is possible for the remote end to send a packet with a data offset that is unvalidated. The problem has been patched in Contiki-NG 4.6. Users can apply the patch for this vulnerability out-of-band as a workaround.",
