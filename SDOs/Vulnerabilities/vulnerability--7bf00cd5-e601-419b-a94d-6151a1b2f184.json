    "description": "The All in One SEO WordPress plugin before 4.1.5.3 is affected by a Privilege Escalation issue, which was discovered during an internal audit by the Jetpack Scan team, and may grant bad actors access to protected REST API endpoints they shouldn\u2019t have access to. This could ultimately enable users with low-privileged accounts, like subscribers, to perform remote code execution on affected sites.",
