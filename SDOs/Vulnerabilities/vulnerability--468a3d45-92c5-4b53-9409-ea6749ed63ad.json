    "description": "An issue was discovered in Total.js CMS 12.0.0. An authenticated user with limited privileges can get access to a resource that they do not own by calling the associated API. The product correctly manages privileges only for the front-end resource path, not for API requests. This leads to vertical and horizontal privilege escalation.",
