    "description": "A reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the iHistorian Data Display of WorkstationST (<v07.09.15) could allow an attacker to compromise a victim's browser. WorkstationST is only deployed in specific, controlled environments rendering attack complexity significantly higher than if the attack were conducted on the software in isolation. WorkstationST v07.09.15 can be found in ControlST v07.09.07 SP8 and greater.",
