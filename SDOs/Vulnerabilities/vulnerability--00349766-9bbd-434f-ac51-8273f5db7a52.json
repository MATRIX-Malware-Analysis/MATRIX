    "description": "Default and unremovable support credentials allow attackers to gain total super user control of an IoT device through a TELNET session to products using the Stanza Lutron integration protocol Revision M to Revision Y. NOTE: The vendor disputes this id as not being a vulnerability because what can be done through the ports revolve around controlling lighting, not code execution.
