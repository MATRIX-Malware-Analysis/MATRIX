    "description": "Unspecified vulnerability in the Application Mgmt Pack for E-Business Suite component in Oracle E-Business Suite 12.1 and 12.2 allows remote attackers to affect confidentiality via vectors related to REST Framework, a different vulnerability than CVE-2016-0457. NOTE: the previous information is from the January 2016 CPU. Oracle has not commented on third-party claims that this issue is an XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerability, which allows remote attackers to read arbitrary files, cause a denial of service, conduct server-side request forgery (SSRF) attacks, or conduct SMB Relay attacks via a crafted DTD in an XML request to OA_HTML/copxmllcmservicecontroller.js.",
