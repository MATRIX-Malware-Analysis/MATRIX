    "description": "An issue was discovered on BLU R1 HD devices with Shanghai Adups software. The content provider named com.adups.fota.sysoper.provider.InfoProvider in the app with a package name of com.adups.fota.sysoper allows any app on the device to read, write, and delete files as the system user. In the com.adups.fota.sysoper app's AndroidManifest.xml file, it sets the android:sharedUserId attribute to a value of android.uid.system which makes it execute as the system user, which is a very privileged user on the device. This allows a third-party app to read, write, and delete the user's sent and received text messages and call log. This allows a third-party app to obtain PII from the user without permission to do so.",
