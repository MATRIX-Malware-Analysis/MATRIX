    "description": "A vulnerability in Black Duck Hub\u2019s embedded MadCap Flare documentation files could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting attack. The vulnerability is due to improper validation of user-supplied input to MadCap Flare's framework embedded within Black Duck Hub's Help Documentation to supply content. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by convincing a user to click a link designed to pass malicious input to the interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to conduct cross-site scripting attacks and gain access to sensitive browser-based information.",
