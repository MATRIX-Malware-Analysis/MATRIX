    "description": "The SonicWall Secure Remote Access server (version 8.1.0.2-14sv) is vulnerable to a Remote Command Injection vulnerability in its web administrative interface. This vulnerability occurs in the 'viewcert' CGI (/cgi-bin/viewcert) component responsible for processing SSL certificate information. The CGI application doesn't properly escape the information it's passed in the 'CERT' variable before a call to system() is performed - allowing for remote command injection. Exploitation of this vulnerability yields shell access to the remote machine under the nobody user account.",
