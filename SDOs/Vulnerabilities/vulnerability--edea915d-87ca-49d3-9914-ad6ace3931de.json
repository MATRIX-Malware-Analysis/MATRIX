    "description": "This Gallery from files WordPress plugin through 1.6.0 gives the functionality of uploading images to the server. But filenames are not properly sanitized before being output in an error message when they have an invalid extension, leading to a reflected Cross-Site Scripting issue. Due to the lack of CSRF check, the attack could also be performed via such vector.",
