    "description": "The Junos Space Network Management Platform has been found to store shared secrets in a recoverable format that can be exposed through the UI. An attacker who is able to execute arbitrary code in the victim browser (for example via XSS) or access cached contents may be able to obtain a copy of credentials managed by Junos Space. The impact of a successful attack includes, but is not limited to, obtaining access to other servers connected to the Junos Space Management Platform. This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos Space versions prior to 20.3R1.",
