    "description": "PC Protect Antivirus v4.14.31 installs by default to %PROGRAMFILES(X86)%\\PCProtect with very weak folder permissions, granting any user full permission \"Everyone: (F)\" to the contents of the directory and its subfolders. In addition, the program installs a service called SecurityService that runs as LocalSystem. This allows any user to escalate privileges to \"NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM\" by substituting the service's binary with a Trojan horse.",
