    "description": "An issue was discovered in ClickHouse before 22.9.1.2603. An attacker could send a crafted HTTP request to the HTTP Endpoint (usually listening on port 8123 by default), causing a heap-based buffer overflow that crashes the process. This does not require authentication. The fixed versions are 22.9.1.2603, 22.8.2.11, 22.7.4.16, 22.6.6.16, and 22.3.12.19.",
