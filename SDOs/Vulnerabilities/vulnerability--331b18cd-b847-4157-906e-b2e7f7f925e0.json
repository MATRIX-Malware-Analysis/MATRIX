    "name": "CTPView: HSTS not being enforced on CTPView server.",
    "description": "The Juniper Networks CTPView server is not enforcing HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS). HSTS is an optional response header which allows servers to indicate that content from the requested domain will only be served over HTTPS. The lack of HSTS may leave the system vulnerable to downgrade attacks, SSL-stripping man-in-the-middle attacks, and weakens cookie-hijacking protections. This issue affects Juniper Networks CTPView: 7.3 versions prior to 7.3R7; 9.1 versions prior to 9.1R3.",
