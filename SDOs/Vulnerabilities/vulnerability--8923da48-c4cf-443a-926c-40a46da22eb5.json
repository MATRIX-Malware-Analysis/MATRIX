    "name": "Junos OS: EX4300 Series: Denial of Service upon receipt of large number of specific valid packets on management interface.",
    "description": "A vulnerability in the pfe-chassisd Chassis Manager (CMLC) daemon of Juniper Networks Junos OS allows an attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS) to the EX4300 when specific valid broadcast packets create a broadcast storm condition when received on the me0 interface of the EX4300 Series device. A reboot of the device is required to restore service. Continued receipt of these valid broadcast packets will create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) against the device. Affected releases are Juniper Networks Junos OS: 16.1 versions above and including 16.1R1 prior to 16.1R7-S5; 17.1 versions prior to 17.1R3; 17.2 versions prior to 17.2R3; 17.3 versions prior to 17.3R3-S2; 17.4 versions prior to 17.4R2; 18.1 versions prior to 18.1R3; 18.2 versions prior to 18.2R2.",
