    "description": "Metabase is data visualization software. Prior to versions 0.44.5, 1.44.5, 0.43.7, 1.43.7, 0.42.6, 1.42.6, 0.41.9, and 1.41.9 single sign on (SSO) users were able to do password resets on Metabase, which could allow a user access without going through the SSO IdP. This issue is patched in versions 0.44.5, 1.44.5, 0.43.7, 1.43.7, 0.42.6, 1.42.6, 0.41.9, and 1.41.9. Metabase now blocks password reset for all users who use SSO for their Metabase login.",
