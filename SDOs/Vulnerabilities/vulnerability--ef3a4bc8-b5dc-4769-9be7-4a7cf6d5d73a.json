    "description": "An issue was discovered in PassMark BurnInTest v9.1 Build 1008, OSForensics v7.1 Build 1012, and PerformanceTest v10.0 Build 1008. The kernel driver exposes IOCTL functionality that allows low-privilege users to map arbitrary physical memory into the address space of the calling process. This could lead to arbitrary Ring-0 code execution and escalation of privileges. This affects DirectIo32.sys and DirectIo64.sys drivers. This issue is fixed in BurnInTest v9.2, PerformanceTest v10.0 Build 1009, OSForensics v8.0.",
