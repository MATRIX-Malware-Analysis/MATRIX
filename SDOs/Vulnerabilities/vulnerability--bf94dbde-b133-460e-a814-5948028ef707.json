    "description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of the Cisco RV110W Wireless-N VPN Firewall, RV130 VPN Router, RV130W Wireless-N Multifunction VPN Router, and RV215W Wireless-N VPN Router could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass authentication and execute arbitrary commands with administrative commands on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to improper session management on affected devices. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to the affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to gain administrative access on the affected device.",
