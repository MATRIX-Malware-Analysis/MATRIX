    "description": "mojoPortal through 2.6.0.0 is prone to multiple persistent cross-site scripting vulnerabilities because it fails to sanitize user-supplied input. The 'Title' and 'Subtitle' fields of the 'Blog' page are vulnerable. NOTE: The software maintainer disputes this as a vulnerability because the fields claimed to be vulnerable to XSS are only available to administrators who are supposed to have access to add scripts",
