    "description": "The Twitter Recommendation Algorithm through ec83d01 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (reduction of reputation score) by arranging for multiple Twitter accounts to coordinate negative signals regarding a target account, such as unfollowing, muting, blocking, and reporting, as exploited in the wild in March and April 2023. NOTE: Vendor states that allowing users to unfollow, mute, block, and report tweets and accounts and the impact of these negative engagements on Twitter\u2019s ranking algorithm is a conscious design decision, rather than a security vulnerability.",
