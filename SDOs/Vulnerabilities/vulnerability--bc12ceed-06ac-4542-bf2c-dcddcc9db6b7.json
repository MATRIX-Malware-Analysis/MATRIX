    "description": "An exploitable command injection vulnerability exists in the iocheckd service \u2018I/O-Check\u2019 function of the WAGO PFC 200 Firmware version 03.02.02(14). A specially crafted XML cache file written to a specific location on the device can be used to inject OS commands. An attacker can send a specially crafted packet to trigger the parsing of this cache file.At 0x1e87c the extracted hostname value from the xml file is used as an argument to /etc/config-tools/change_hostname hostname=<contents of hostname node> using sprintf(). This command is later executed via a call to system().",
