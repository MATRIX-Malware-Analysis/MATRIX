    "description": "Nextcloud Server is the file server software for Nextcloud, a self-hosted productivity platform. Nextcloud Server prior to versions 23.0.10 and 24.0.6 and Nextcloud Enterprise Server prior to versions 22.2.10, 23.0.10, and 24.0.6 are vulnerable to a logged-in attacker slowing down the system by generating a lot of database/cpu load. Nextcloud Server versions 23.0.10 and 24.0.6 and Nextcloud Enterprise Server versions 22.2.10, 23.0.10, and 24.0.6 contain patches for this issue. As a workaround, disable the Circles app.",
