    "description": "The pagebar WordPress plugin before 2.70 does not have CSRF check in place when updating its settings, which could allow attackers to make a logged in admin change them via a CSRF attack. Furthermore, due to the lack of sanitisation in some of them, it could also lead to Stored XSS issues",
