    "description": "erohtar/Dasherr is a dashboard for self-hosted services. In affected versions unrestricted file upload allows any unauthenticated user to execute arbitrary code on the server. The file /www/include/filesave.php allows for any file to uploaded to anywhere. If an attacker uploads a php file they can execute code on the server. This issue has been addressed in version 1.05.00. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.\n",
