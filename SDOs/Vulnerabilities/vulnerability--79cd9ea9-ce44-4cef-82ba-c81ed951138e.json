    "description": "The Super Store Finder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthenticated arbitrary email creation and relay in versions up to, and including, 6.9.3. This is due to insufficient restrictions on the sendMail.php file that allows direct access. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to send emails utilizing the vulnerable site's server, with arbitrary content. Please note that this vulnerability has already been publicly disclosed with an exploit which is why we are publishing the details without a patch available, we are attempting to initiate contact with the developer.",
