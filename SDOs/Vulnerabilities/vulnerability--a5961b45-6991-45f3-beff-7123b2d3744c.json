    "name": "Gradio contains Use of Hard-coded Credentials",
    "description": "Gradio is an open-source Python library to build machine learning and data science demos and web applications. Versions prior to 3.13.1 contain Use of Hard-coded Credentials. When using Gradio's share links (i.e. creating a Gradio app and then setting `share=True`), a private SSH key is sent to any user that connects to the Gradio machine, which means that a user could access other users' shared Gradio demos. From there, other exploits are possible depending on the level of access/exposure the Gradio app provides. This issue is patched in version 3.13.1, however, users  are recommended to update to 3.19.1 or later where the FRP solution has been properly tested. ",
