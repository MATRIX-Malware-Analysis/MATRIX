    "description": "The Server Administration Panel in Parallels Plesk Panel 10.2.0_build1011110331.18 sends incorrect Content-Type headers for certain resources, which might allow remote attackers to have an unspecified impact by leveraging an interpretation conflict involving smb/admin-home/disable-featured-applications-promo and certain other files.
