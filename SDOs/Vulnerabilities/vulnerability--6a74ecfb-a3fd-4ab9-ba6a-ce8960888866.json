    "description": "An issue was discovered in SmartClient 12.0. If an unauthenticated attacker makes a POST request to /tools/developerConsoleOperations.jsp or /isomorphic/IDACall with malformed XML data in the _transaction parameter, the server replies with a verbose error showing where the application resides (the absolute path). NOTE: the documentation states \"These tools are, by default, available to anyone ... so they should only be deployed into a trusted environment. Alternately, the tools can easily be restricted to administrators or end users by protecting the tools path with normal authentication and authorization mechanisms on the web server.\"",
