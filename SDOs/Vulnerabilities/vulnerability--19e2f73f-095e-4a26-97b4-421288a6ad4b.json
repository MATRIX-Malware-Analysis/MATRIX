    "name": "The Plus Addons for Elementor Page Builder < 4.1.11 - Arbitrary Reset Pwd Email Sending",
    "description": "The Plus Addons for Elementor Page Builder WordPress plugin before 4.1.11 did not properly check that a user requesting a password reset was the legitimate user, allowing an attacker to send an arbitrary reset password email to a registered user on behalf of the WordPress site. Such issue could be chained with an open redirect (CVE-2021-24358) in version below 4.1.10, to include a crafted password reset link in the email, which would lead to an account takeover.",
