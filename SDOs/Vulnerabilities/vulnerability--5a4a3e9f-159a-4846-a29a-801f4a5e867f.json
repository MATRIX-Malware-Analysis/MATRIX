    "description": "Applications developed using the Portrait Display SDK, versions 2.30 through 2.34, default to insecure configurations which allow arbitrary code execution. A number of applications developed using the Portrait Displays SDK do not use secure permissions when running. These applications run the component pdiservice.exe with NT AUTHORITY/SYSTEM permissions. This component is also read/writable by all Authenticated Users. This allows local authenticated attackers to run arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges. The following applications have been identified by Portrait Displays as affected: Fujitsu DisplayView Click: Version 6.0 and 6.01. The issue was fixed in Version 6.3. Fujitsu DisplayView Click Suite: Version 5. The issue is addressed by patch in Version 5.9. HP Display Assistant: Version 2.1. The issue was fixed in Version 2.11. HP My Display: Version 2.0. The issue was fixed in Version 2.1. Philips Smart Control Premium: Versions 2.23, 2.25. The issue was fixed in Version 2.26.",
