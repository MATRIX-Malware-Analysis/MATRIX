The vulnerability is due to insufficient authorization enforcement for requests to delete scheduled meeting templates. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted request to the Webex Meetings interface to delete a scheduled meeting template. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to delete a scheduled meeting template that belongs to a user other than themselves.",
