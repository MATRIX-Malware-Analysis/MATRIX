    "description": "Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in Drupal 5.x before 5.18 and 6.x before 6.12 allow (1) remote authenticated users to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via crafted UTF-8 byte sequences that are treated as UTF-7 by Internet Explorer 6 and 7, which are not properly handled in the \"HTML exports of books\" feature; and (2) allow remote authenticated users with administer taxonomy permissions to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the help text of an arbitrary vocabulary.  NOTE: vector 1 exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2009-1575.",
