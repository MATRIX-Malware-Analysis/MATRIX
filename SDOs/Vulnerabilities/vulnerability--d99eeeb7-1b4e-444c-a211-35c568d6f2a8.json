    "description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Identity Services Engine could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to take privileges actions within the web-based management interface.\r\n\r This vulnerability is due to improper access control on a feature within the web-based management interface of the affected system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by accessing features through direct requests, bypassing checks within the application. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to take privileged actions within the web-based management interface that should be otherwise restricted.\r\n\r    \r\n\r  {{value}} [\"%7b%7bvalue%7d%7d\"])}]]\r\n",
