    "description": "On Juniper Networks EX4300-MP Series, EX4600 Series and QFX5K Series deployed in a Virtual Chassis configuration, receipt of a stream of specific layer 2 frames can cause high CPU load, which could lead to traffic interruption. This issue does not occur when the device is deployed in Stand Alone configuration. The offending layer 2 frame packets can originate only from within the broadcast domain where the device is connected. This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS on EX4300-MP Series, EX4600 Series and QFX5K Series: 17.3 versions prior to 17.3R3-S9; 17.4 versions prior to 17.4R2-S11, 17.4R3-S2, 17.4R3-S3; 18.1 versions prior to 18.1R3-S11; 18.2 versions prior to 18.2R3-S5; 18.3 versions prior to 18.3R2-S4, 18.3R3-S3; 18.4 versions prior to 18.4R2-S5, 18.4R3-S4; 19.1 versions prior to 19.1R3-S2; 19.2 versions prior to 19.2R1-S5, 19.2R3; 19.3 versions prior to 19.3R2-S4, 19.3R3; 19.4 versions prior to 19.4R1-S3, 19.4R2-S1, 19.4R3; 20.1 versions prior to 20.1R1-S3, 20.1R2.",
