    "description": "A vulnerability in multiple management dashboard pages of Cisco Umbrella could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the Cisco Umbrella dashboard.\r\n\r This vulnerability is due to unsanitized user input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting custom JavaScript to the web application and persuading a user of the interface to click a maliciously crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the interface or access sensitive browser-based information.",
