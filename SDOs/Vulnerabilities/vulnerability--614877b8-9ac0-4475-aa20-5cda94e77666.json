    "name": "Cisco TelePresence Endpoint Command Shell Injection Vulnerability",
    "description": "A vulnerability in the Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP) implementation for the Cisco TelePresence Codec (TC) and Collaboration Endpoint (CE) Software could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to inject arbitrary shell commands that are executed by the device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of received CDP packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted CDP packets to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary shell commands or scripts on the targeted device.",
