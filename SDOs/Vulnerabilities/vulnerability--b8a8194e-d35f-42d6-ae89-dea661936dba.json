    "description": "On BIG-IP version 16.0.x before 16.0.1.1 and 15.1.x before 15.1.3, malformed HTTP/2 requests may cause an infinite loop which causes a Denial of Service for Data Plane traffic. TMM takes the configured HA action when the TMM process is aborted. There is no control plane exposure, this is a data plane issue only.
