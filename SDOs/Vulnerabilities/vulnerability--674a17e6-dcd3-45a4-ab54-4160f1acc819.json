NOTE: the previous information was obtained from the January 2011 CPU.  Oracle has not commented on claims from a reliable third party coordinator that this issue involves an exposed JSP script that accepts XML uploads in conjunction with NULL bytes in an unspecified parameter that allow execution of arbitrary code.",
