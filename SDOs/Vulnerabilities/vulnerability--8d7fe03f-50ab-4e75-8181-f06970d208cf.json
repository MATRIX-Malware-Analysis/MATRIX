    "description": "libsecurity in Apple Mac OS X before 10.7.4 does not properly restrict the length of RSA keys within X.509 certificates, which makes it easier for remote attackers to defeat cryptographic protection mechanisms by conducting a spoofing or network-sniffing attack during communication with a site that uses a short key.",
