    "description": "jellyfin-web is the web client for Jellyfin, a free-software media system. Starting in version 10.1.0 and prior to version 10.8.10, a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability in device.js can be used to make arbitrary calls to the `REST` endpoints with admin privileges. When combined with CVE-2023-30626, this results in remote code execution on the Jellyfin instance in the context of the user who's running it. This issue is patched in version 10.8.10. There are no known workarounds.",
