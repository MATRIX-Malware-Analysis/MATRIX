    "name": "Medtronic Micro Clinician & InterStim X Clinician App Password Reset Issue",
    "description": "Medtronic identified that the Pelvic Health clinician apps, which are installed on the Smart Programmer mobile device, have a password vulnerability that requires a security update to fix. Not updating could potentially result in unauthorized control of the clinician therapy application, which has greater control over therapy parameters than the patient app.  Changes still cannot be made outside of the established therapy parameters of the programmer.  For unauthorized access to occur, an individual would need physical access to the Smart Programmer. \n\n",
