    "description": "An issue was discovered in the tshirtecommerce (aka Custom Product Designer) component 2.1.4 for PrestaShop. An HTTP request can be forged with the POST parameter type in the /tshirtecommerce/fonts.php endpoint, to allow a remote attacker to traverse directories on the system in order to open files (without restriction on the extension and path). The content of the file is returned with base64 encoding. This is exploited in the wild in March 2023.",
