    "description": "A vulnerability in Cisco Umbrella Insights Virtual Appliances 2.1.0 and earlier could allow an authenticated, local attacker to log in to an affected virtual appliance with root privileges. The vulnerability is due to the presence of default, static user credentials for an affected virtual appliance. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using the hypervisor console to connect locally to an affected system and then using the static credentials to log in to an affected virtual appliance. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to log in to the affected appliance with root privileges. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvg31220.",
