    "description": "A vulnerability in the Graphite interface of Cisco HyperFlex software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to write arbitrary data to the Graphite interface. The vulnerability is due to insufficient authorization controls. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by connecting to the Graphite service and sending arbitrary data. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to write arbitrary data to Graphite, which could result in invalid statistics being presented in the interface. Versions prior to 3.5(2a) are affected.",
