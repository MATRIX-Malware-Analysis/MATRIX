    "description": "Absolute Computrace Agent V80.845 and V80.866 does not have a digital signature for the configuration block, which allows attackers to set up communication with a web site other than the intended search.namequery.com site by modifying data within a disk's inter-partition space. This allows a privileged local user to execute arbitrary code even after that user loses access and all disk partitions are reformatted.",
