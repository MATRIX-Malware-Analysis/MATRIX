    "description": "Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in osCommerce/OM/Core/Site/Setup/Application/Install/RPC/DBCheck.php in OSCommerce Online Merchant 3.0.2, when the software is being installed, allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the name parameter to oscommerce/index.php, which is not properly handled in an error message.  NOTE: this might not be a vulnerability, since the ability to access oscommerce/index.php during installation may already imply administrator privileges.",
