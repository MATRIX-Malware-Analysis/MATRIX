    "description": "Traefik is an open source HTTP reverse proxy and load balancer. Versions prior to 2.9.6 are subject to a potential vulnerability in Traefik displaying the Authorization header in its debug logs. In certain cases, if the log level is set to DEBUG, credentials provided using the Authorization header are displayed in the debug logs.

Users unable to upgrade may set the log level to `INFO`, `WARN`, or `ERROR`.",
