    "description": "Forms generated by JQueryForm.com before 2022-02-05 (if file-upload capability is enabled) allow remote unauthenticated attackers to upload executable files and achieve remote code execution. This occurs because file-extension checks occur on the client side, and because not all executable content (e.g., .phtml or .php.bak) is blocked.",
