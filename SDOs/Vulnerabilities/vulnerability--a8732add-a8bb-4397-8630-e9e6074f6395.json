    "name": "Contrail Service Orchestration: Tenants able to see other tenants policies via REST API interface",
    "description": "A Protection Mechanism Failure vulnerability in the REST API of Juniper Networks Contrail Service Orchestration allows one tenant on the system to view confidential configuration details of another tenant on the same system. By utilizing the REST API, one tenant is able to obtain information on another tenant's firewall configuration and access control policies, as well as other sensitive information, exposing the tenant to reduced defense against malicious attacks or exploitation via additional undetermined vulnerabilities. This issue affects Juniper Networks Contrail Service Orchestration versions prior to 6.1.0 Patch 3.",
