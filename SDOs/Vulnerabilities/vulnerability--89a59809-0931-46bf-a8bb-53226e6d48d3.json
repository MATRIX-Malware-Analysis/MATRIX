    "description": "Stack-based buffer overflow in War FTP Daemon 1.65, and possibly earlier, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service or execute arbitrary code via unspecified vectors, as demonstrated by warftp_165.tar by Immunity.  NOTE: this might be the same issue as CVE-1999-0256, CVE-2000-0131, or CVE-2006-2171, but due to Immunity's lack of details, this cannot be certain.",
