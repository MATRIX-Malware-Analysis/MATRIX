    "description": "Users were able to set an arbitrary \"product name\" for OX Guard. The chosen value was not sufficiently sanitized before processing it at the user interface, allowing for indirect cross-site scripting attacks. Accounts that were temporarily taken over could be configured to trigger persistent code execution, allowing an attacker to build a foothold. Sanitization is in place for product names now. No publicly available exploits are known.\n\n",
