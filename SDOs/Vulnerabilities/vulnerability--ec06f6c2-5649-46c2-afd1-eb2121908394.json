    "description": "A command injection in the parsing_xml_stasurvey function inside libcgifunc.so of the D-Link DAP-X1860 repeater 1.00 through 1.01b05-01 allows attackers (within range of the repeater) to run shell commands as root during the setup process of the repeater, via a crafted SSID. Also, network names containing single quotes (in the range of the repeater) can result in a denial of service.",
