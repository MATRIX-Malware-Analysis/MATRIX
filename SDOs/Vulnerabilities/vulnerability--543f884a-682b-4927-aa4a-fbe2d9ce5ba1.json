    "description": "An issue was discovered in Veritas APTARE 10.4 before 10.4P9 and 10.5 before 10.5P3. By default, on Windows systems, users can create directories under C:\\. A low privileged user can create a directory at the configuration file locations. When the Windows system restarts, a malicious OpenSSL engine could exploit arbitrary code execution as SYSTEM. This gives the attacker administrator access on the system, allowing the attacker (by default) to access all data, access all installed applications, etc.",
