    "description": "The Download Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to deserialization of untrusted input via the 'file[package_dir]' parameter in versions up to, and including 3.2.49. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with contributor privileges and above to call files using a PHAR wrapper that will deserialize the data and call arbitrary PHP Objects that can be used to perform a variety of malicious actions granted a POP chain is also present. It also requires that the attacker is successful in uploading a file with the serialized payload.",
