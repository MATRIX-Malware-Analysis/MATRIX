    "description": "A vulnerability in the OSPF Version 2 (OSPFv2) implementation of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an affected device to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to incomplete input validation when the affected software processes certain OSPFv2 packets with Link-Local Signaling (LLS) data. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malformed OSPFv2 packet to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause an affected device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition.",
