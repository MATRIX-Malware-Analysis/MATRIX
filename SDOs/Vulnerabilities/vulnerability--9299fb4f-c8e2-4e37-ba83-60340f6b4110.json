    "description": "PeerSec MatrixSSL before 1.1 does not implement RSA blinding, which allows context-dependent attackers to obtain the server's private key by determining factors using timing differences on (1) the number of extra reductions during Montgomery reduction, and (2) the use of different integer multiplication algorithms (\"Karatsuba\" and normal), a related issue to CVE-2003-0147.",
