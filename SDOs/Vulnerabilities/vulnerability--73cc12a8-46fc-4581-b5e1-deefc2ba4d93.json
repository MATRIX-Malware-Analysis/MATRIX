    "description": "Rockwell Automation PowerFlex 525 AC Drives 5.001 and earlier allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service by crashing the Common Industrial Protocol (CIP) network stack. The vulnerability allows the attacker to crash the CIP in a way that it does not accept new connections, but keeps the current connections active, which can prevent legitimate users from recovering control.",
