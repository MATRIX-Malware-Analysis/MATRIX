    "description": "A flaw was found in CryptoPro Secure Disk bootloaders before 2022-06-01. An attacker may use this bootloader to bypass or tamper with Secure Boot protections. In order to load and execute arbitrary code in the pre-boot stage, an attacker simply needs to replace the existing signed bootloader currently in use with this bootloader.
