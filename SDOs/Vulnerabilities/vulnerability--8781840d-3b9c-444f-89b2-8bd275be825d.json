    "name": "Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved: In bidirectional LSP configurations, on MPLS egress router RPD may core upon receipt of specific malformed RSVP packet.",
    "description": "An improper input validation vulnerability in the Routing Protocol Daemon (RPD) service of Juniper Networks Junos OS allows an attacker to send a malformed RSVP packet when bidirectional LSPs are in use, which when received by an egress router crashes the RPD causing a Denial of Service (DoS) condition. Continued receipt of the packet will sustain the Denial of Service. This issue affects: Juniper Networks Junos OS: All versions prior to 17.3R3-S10 except 15.1X49-D240 for SRX series; 17.4 versions prior to 17.4R3-S2; 18.1 versions prior to 18.1R3-S10; 18.2 versions prior to 18.2R2-S7, 18.2R3-S4; 18.3 versions prior to 18.3R3-S2; 18.4 versions prior to 18.4R1-S8, 18.4R2-S6, 18.4R3-S2; 19.1 versions prior to 19.1R1-S5, 19.1R3-S3; 19.2 versions prior to 19.2R3; 19.3 versions prior to 19.3R2-S5, 19.3R3; 19.4 versions prior to 19.4R2-S2, 19.4R3-S1; 20.1 versions prior to 20.1R1-S4, 20.1R2; 15.1X49 versions prior to 15.1X49-D240 on SRX Series.
