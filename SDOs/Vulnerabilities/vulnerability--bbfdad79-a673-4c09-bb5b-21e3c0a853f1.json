    "description": "The connection establishment algorithm found in Rockwell Automation CompactLogix 5370 and ControlLogix 5570 versions 33 and prior does not sufficiently manage its control flow during execution, creating an infinite loop. This may allow an attacker to send specially crafted CIP packet requests to a controller, which may cause denial-of-service conditions in communications with other products.",
