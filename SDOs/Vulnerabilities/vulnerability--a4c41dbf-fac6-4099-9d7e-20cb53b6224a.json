    "description": "A vulnerability has been identified in JT2Go (All versions < V13.1.0), Teamcenter Visualization (All versions < V13.1.0). Affected applications lack proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing of TGA files. This could lead to a heap-based buffer overflow. An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. (ZDI-CAN-12016, ZDI-CAN-12017)",
