    "description": "Sails is a realtime MVC Framework for Node.js. In Sails apps prior to version 1.5.7,, an attacker can send a virtual request that will cause the node process to crash. This behavior was fixed in Sails v1.5.7. As a workaround, disable the sockets hook and remove the `sails.io.js` client.",
