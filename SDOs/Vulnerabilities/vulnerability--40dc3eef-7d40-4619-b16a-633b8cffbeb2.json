    "description": "A vulnerability in the web proxy functionality of Cisco AsyncOS Software for Cisco Web Security Appliance could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to improper validation of HTTP and HTTPS requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malformed HTTP or HTTPS request to an affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause a restart of the web proxy process, resulting in a temporary DoS condition.",
