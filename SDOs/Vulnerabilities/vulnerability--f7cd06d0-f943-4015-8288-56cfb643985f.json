    "description": "A vulnerability has been identified in Mendix Applications using Mendix 7 (All versions < V7.23.29), Mendix Applications using Mendix 8 (All versions < V8.18.16), Mendix Applications using Mendix 9 (All deployments with Runtime Custom Setting *DataStorage.UseNewQueryHandler* set to False). If an entity has an association readable by the user, then in some cases, Mendix Runtime may not apply checks for XPath constraints that parse said associations, within apps running on affected versions. A malicious user could use this to dump and manipulate sensitive data.",
