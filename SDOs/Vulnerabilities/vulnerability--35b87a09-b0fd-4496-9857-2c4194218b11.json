    "name": "cross-site inclusion (XSSI) of files in jupyter-server",
    "description": "jupyter-server is the backend for Jupyter web applications. Improper cross-site credential checks on `/files/` URLs could allow exposure of certain file contents, or accessing files when opening untrusted files via  \"Open image in new tab\". This issue has been addressed in commit `87a49272728` which has been included in release `2.7.2`. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may use the lower performance `--ContentsManager.files_handler_class=jupyter_server.files.handlers.FilesHandler`, which implements the correct checks.",
