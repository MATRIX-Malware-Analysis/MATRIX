    "description": "A vulnerability in the input protection mechanisms of Cisco Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to view data without proper authorization. This vulnerability exists because of a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of a specific input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by modifying this input to bypass the protection mechanism and sending a crafted request to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view data beyond the scope of their authorization.",
