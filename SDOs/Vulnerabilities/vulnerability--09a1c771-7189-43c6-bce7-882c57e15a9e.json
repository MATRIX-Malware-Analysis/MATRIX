    "description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Unified Customer Voice Portal (CVP) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to perform a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user. This vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of a parameter that is used by the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to click a malicious link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the interface, access sensitive, browser-based information, or cause an affected device to reboot under certain conditions.",
