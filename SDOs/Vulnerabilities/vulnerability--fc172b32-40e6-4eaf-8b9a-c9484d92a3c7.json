    "description": "Two stack-based buffer overflow vulnerabilities have been discovered in CX-One Versions 4.42 and prior (CX-Programmer Versions 9.66 and prior and CX-Server Versions 5.0.23 and prior). When processing project files, the application allows input data to exceed the buffer. An attacker could use a specially crafted project file to overflow the buffer and execute code under the privileges of the application.",
