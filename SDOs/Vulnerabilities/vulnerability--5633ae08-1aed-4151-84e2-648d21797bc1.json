    "description": "A null byte interaction error has been discovered in the code that the telnetd_startup daemon uses to construct a pair of ephemeral passwords that allow a user to spawn a telnet service on the router, and to ensure that the telnet service persists upon reboot. By means of a crafted exchange of UDP packets, an unauthenticated attacker on the local network can leverage this null byte interaction error in such a way as to make those ephemeral passwords predictable (with 1-in-94 odds). Since the attacker must manipulate data processed by the OpenSSL function RSA_public_decrypt(), successful exploitation of this vulnerability depends on the use of an unpadded RSA cipher (CVE-2022-25218).",
