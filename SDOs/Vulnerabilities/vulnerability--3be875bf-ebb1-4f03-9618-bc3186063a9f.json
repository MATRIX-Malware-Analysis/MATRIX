    "description": "SAP BusinessObjects Business Intelligence Platform - version 420, 430, allows an unauthorized attacker who had hijacked a user session, to be able to bypass the victim\u2019s old password via brute force, due to unrestricted rate limit for password change functionality. Although the attack has no impact on integrity loss or system availability, this could lead to an attacker to completely takeover a victim\u2019s account.\n\n",
