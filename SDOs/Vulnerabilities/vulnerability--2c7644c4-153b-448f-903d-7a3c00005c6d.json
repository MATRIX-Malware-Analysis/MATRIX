    "description": "On F5 BIG-IP 16.1.x versions prior to 16.1.2.2, 15.1.x versions prior to 15.1.5.1, 14.1.x versions prior to 14.1.4.6, 13.1.x versions prior to 13.1.5, and all versions of 12.1.x and 11.6.x, a flaw in the way reply ICMP packets are limited in the Traffic Management Microkernel (TMM) allows an attacker to quickly scan open UDP ports.
