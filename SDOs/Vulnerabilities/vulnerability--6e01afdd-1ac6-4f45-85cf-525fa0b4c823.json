    "description": "An issue was discovered in Open Source Social Network (OSSN) through 5.3. A user-controlled file path with a weak cryptographic rand() can be used to read any file with the permissions of the webserver. This can lead to further compromise. The attacker must conduct a brute-force attack against the SiteKey to insert into a crafted URL for components/OssnComments/ossn_com.php and/or libraries/ossn.lib.upgrade.php.",
