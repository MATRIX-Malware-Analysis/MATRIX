    "description": "Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference vulnerability in MIM Assistant and Client DICOM RTst Loading modules allows XML Entity Linking / XML External Entities Blowup.\n\n\n\n\nIn order to take advantage of this vulnerability, an attacker must \ncraft a malicious XML document, embed this document into specific 3rd \nparty private RTst metadata tags, transfer the now compromised \nDICOM object to MIM, and force MIM to archive and load the data.\n\nUsers on either version are strongly encouraged to update to an unaffected version (7.2.11+, 7.3.4+).\n\nThis issue was found and analyzed by MIM Software's internal security team.\u00a0 We are unaware of any proof of concept or actual exploit available in the wild.\n\n\nFor more information, visit  https://www.mimsoftware.com/cve-2023-3892 https://www.mimsoftware.com/cve-2023-3892 \n\n\n\n\nThis issue affects MIM Assistant: 7.2.10, 7.3.3; MIM Client: 7.2.10, 7.3.3.\n\n\n",
