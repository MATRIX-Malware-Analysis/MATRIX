    "description": "An issue was discovered on Spirent TestCenter and Avalanche appliance admin interface firmware. An attacker, who already has access to an SSH restricted shell, can achieve root access via shell metacharacters. The attacker can then, for example, read sensitive files such as appliance admin configuration source code. This affects Spirent TestCenter and Avalanche products which chassis version <= 5.08. The SSH restricted shell is available with default credentials.",
