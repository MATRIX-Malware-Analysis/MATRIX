    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Foxit Reader 9.2.0.9297. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the handling of the removeField property of a app object. The issue results from the lack of validating the existence of an object prior to performing operations on the object.
