    "description": "Nextcloud Server provides data storage for Nextcloud, an open source cloud platform. Starting in version 25.0.0 and prior to versions 25.0.9, 26.0.4, and 27.0.1, unauthenticated users could send a DAV request which reveals whether a calendar or an address book with the given identifier exists for the victim. Nextcloud Server versions 25.0.9, 26.0.4, and 27.0.1 and Nextcloud Enterprise Server versions 25.0.9, 26.0.4, and 27.0.1 contain a patch for this issue. No known workarounds are available.",
