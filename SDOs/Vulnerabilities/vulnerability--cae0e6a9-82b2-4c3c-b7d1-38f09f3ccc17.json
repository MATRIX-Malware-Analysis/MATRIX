    "description": "In generator-jhipster-kotlin version 1.6.0 log entries are created for invalid password reset attempts. As the email is provided by a user and the api is public this can be used by an attacker to forge log entries. This is vulnerable to https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/117.html This problem affects only application generated with jwt or session authentication. Applications using oauth are not vulnerable. This issue has been fixed in version 1.7.0.",
