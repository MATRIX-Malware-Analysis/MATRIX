    "description": "A vulnerability in the Cisco Webex Network Recording Player for Microsoft Windows and the Cisco Webex Player for Microsoft Windows could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on an affected system. The vulnerability exist because the affected software improperly validates Advanced Recording Format (ARF) and Webex Recording Format (WRF) files. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a user a malicious ARF or WRF file via a link or email attachment and persuading the user to open the file with the affected software. Successful exploitation could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected system.",
