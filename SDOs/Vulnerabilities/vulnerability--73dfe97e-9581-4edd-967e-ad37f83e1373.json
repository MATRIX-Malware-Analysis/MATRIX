    "description": "Razer Synapse before 3.7.0830.081906 allows privilege escalation due to an unsafe installation path, improper privilege management, and improper certificate validation. Attackers can place malicious DLLs into %PROGRAMDATA%\\Razer\\Synapse3\\Service\\bin if they do so before the service is installed and if they deny write access for the SYSTEM user. Although the service will not start if the malicious DLLs are unsigned, it suffices to use self-signed DLLs. The validity of the DLL signatures is not checked. As a result, local Windows users can abuse the Razer driver installer to obtain administrative privileges on Windows.",
