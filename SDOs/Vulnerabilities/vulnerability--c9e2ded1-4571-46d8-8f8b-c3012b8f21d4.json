    "description": "The TLS implementation in EMC RSA BSAFE-C Toolkits (aka Share for C and C++) sends a long series of random bytes during use of the Dual_EC_DRBG algorithm, which makes it easier for remote attackers to obtain plaintext from TLS sessions by recovering the algorithm's inner state, a different issue than CVE-2007-6755.",
