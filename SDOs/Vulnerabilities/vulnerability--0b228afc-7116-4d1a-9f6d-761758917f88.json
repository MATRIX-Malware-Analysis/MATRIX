    "description": "NOTE: this issue has been disputed by the vendor. Symantec Norton AntiVirus 2002 allows remote attackers to send viruses that bypass the e-mail scanning via a NULL character in the MIME header before the virus.  NOTE: the vendor has disputed this issue, acknowledging that the initial scan is bypassed, but the AutoProtect feature would detect the virus before it is executed",
