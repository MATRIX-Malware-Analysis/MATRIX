    "description": "Buffer overflow in Winzip32.exe in WinZip 9.0 allows local users to cause a denial of service (application crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a long command line argument.  NOTE: this issue may cross privilege boundaries if an application automatically invokes Winzip32.exe for untrusted input filenames, as in the case of a file upload application.
