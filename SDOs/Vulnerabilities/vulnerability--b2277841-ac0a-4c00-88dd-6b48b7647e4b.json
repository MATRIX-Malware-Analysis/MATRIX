    "name": "MyBB Cross-Poster <= 1.0 Authenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting",
    "description": "The MyBB Cross-Poster WordPress plugin is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting due to insufficient input validation and sanitization via several parameters found in the ~/classes/MyBBXPSettings.php file which allowed attackers with administrative user access to inject arbitrary web scripts, in versions up to and including 1.0. This affects multi-site installations where unfiltered_html is disabled for administrators, and sites where unfiltered_html is disabled.",
