    "name": "Potential share collision for recipients when caching is enabled in nextcloud server",
    "description": "Nextcloud server is an open source home cloud implementation. In affected versions when a recipient receives 2 shares with the same name, while a memory cache is configured, the second share will replace the first one instead of being renamed to `{name} (2)`. It is recommended that the Nextcloud Server is upgraded to 25.0.3 or 24.0.9. Users unable to upgrade should avoid sharing 2 folders with the same name to the same user.",
