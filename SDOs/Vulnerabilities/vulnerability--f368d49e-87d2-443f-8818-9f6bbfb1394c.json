    "description": "An issue was discovered on Moxa AWK-3121 1.14 devices. The device by default allows HTTP traffic thus providing an insecure communication mechanism for a user connecting to the web server. This allows an attacker to sniff the traffic easily and allows an attacker to compromise sensitive data such as credentials.",
