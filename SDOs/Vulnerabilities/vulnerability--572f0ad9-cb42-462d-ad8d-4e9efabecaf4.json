    "description": "Directory traversal vulnerability in action.php in phpXplorer allows remote attackers to read arbitrary files via \"..\" (dot dot) sequences and null bytes in the sAction parameter, a different vulnerability than CVE-2006-0244.  NOTE: if the functionality of phpXplorer supports the upload of PHP files, then this issue would not cross privilege boundaries and would not be a vulnerability.",
