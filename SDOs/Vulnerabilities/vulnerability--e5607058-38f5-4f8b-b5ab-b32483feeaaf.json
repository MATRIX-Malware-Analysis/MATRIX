    "description": "JBoss Fuse did not enable encrypted passwords by default in its usage of Apache Zookeeper. This permitted sensitive information disclosure via logging to local users. Note: this description has been updated; previous text mistakenly identified the source of the flaw as Zookeeper. Previous text: Apache Zookeeper logs cleartext admin passwords, which allows local users to obtain sensitive information by reading the log.",
