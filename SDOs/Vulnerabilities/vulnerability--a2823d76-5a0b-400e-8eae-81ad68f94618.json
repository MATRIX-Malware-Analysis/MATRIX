    "description": "/cgi-bin/wapopen in Boa 0.94.14rc21 allows the injection of \"../..\" using the FILECAMERA variable (sent by GET) to read files with root privileges. NOTE: multiple third parties report that this is a system-integrator issue (e.g., a vulnerability on one type of camera) because Boa does not include any wapopen program or any code to read a FILECAMERA variable.",
