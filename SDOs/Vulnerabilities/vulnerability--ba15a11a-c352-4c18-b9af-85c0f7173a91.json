    "description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Identity Services Engine could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct cross-site scripting attacks against other users of the application web-based management interface.\r\n\r This vulnerability is due to improper validation of input to an application feature before storage within the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by creating entries within the application interface that contain malicious HTML or script code. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to store malicious HTML or script code within the application interface for use in further cross-site scripting attacks.\r\n\r Cisco has not yet released software updates that address this vulnerability.
