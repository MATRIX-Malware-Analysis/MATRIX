    "description": "Unspecified vulnerability in the Oracle Application Testing Suite component in Oracle Enterprise Manager Grid Control 12.4.0.2 and 12.5.0.2 allows remote authenticated users to affect confidentiality, integrity, and availability via unknown vectors related to Test Manager for Web Apps.  NOTE: the previous information is from the January 2016 CPU. Oracle has not commented on third-party claims that this is a directory traversal vulnerability in the ActionServlet servlet, which allows remote authenticated users to upload and execute arbitrary files via directory traversal sequences in the tempfilename parameter in a ReportImage action.",
