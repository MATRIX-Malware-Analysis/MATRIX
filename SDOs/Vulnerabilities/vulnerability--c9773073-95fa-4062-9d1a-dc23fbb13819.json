    "description": "With Cloud Foundry Runtime cf-release versions v209 or earlier, UAA Standalone versions 2.2.6 or earlier and Pivotal Cloud Foundry Runtime 1.4.5 or earlier the change_email form in UAA is vulnerable to a CSRF attack. This allows an attacker to trigger an e-mail change for a user logged into a cloud foundry instance via a malicious link on a attacker controlled site. This vulnerability is applicable only when using the UAA internal user store for authentication. Deployments enabled for integration via SAML or LDAP are not affected.",
