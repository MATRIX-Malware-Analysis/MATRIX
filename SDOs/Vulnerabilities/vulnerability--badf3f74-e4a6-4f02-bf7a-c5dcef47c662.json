    "description": "EMC RSA BSAFE Crypto-J versions prior to 6.2.2 has a PKCS#12 Timing Attack Vulnerability. A possible timing attack could be carried out by modifying a PKCS#12 file that has an integrity MAC for which the password is not known. An attacker could then feed the modified PKCS#12 file to the toolkit and guess the current MAC one byte at a time. This is possible because Crypto-J uses a non-constant-time method to compare the stored MAC with the calculated MAC. This vulnerability is similar to the issue described in CVE-2015-2601.",
