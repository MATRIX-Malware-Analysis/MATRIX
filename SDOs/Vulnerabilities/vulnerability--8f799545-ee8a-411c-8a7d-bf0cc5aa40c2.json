    "description": "A vulnerability in the CLI of Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN Software and Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to execute arbitrary commands with elevated privileges on an affected device. This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of arguments passed to certain CLI commands. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by including malicious input in the argument of an affected command. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands with elevated privileges on the underlying operating system. An attacker would need valid user credentials to exploit this vulnerability.",
