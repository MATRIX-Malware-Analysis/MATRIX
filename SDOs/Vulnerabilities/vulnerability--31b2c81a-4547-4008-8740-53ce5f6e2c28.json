    "description": "An Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions vulnerability in the Packet Forwarding Engine (PFE) of Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved on ACX7000 Series allows an unauthenticated network-based attacker to cause a partial Denial of Service (DoS). On receipt of specific IPv6 transit traffic, Junos OS Evolved on ACX7100-48L, ACX7100-32C and ACX7509 sends this traffic to the Routing Engine (RE) instead of forwarding it, leading to increased CPU utilization of the RE and a partial DoS. This issue only affects systems configured with IPv6. This issue does not affect ACX7024 which is supported from 22.3R1-EVO onwards where the fix has already been incorporated as indicated in the solution section. This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved on ACX7100-48L, ACX7100-32C, ACX7509: 21.1-EVO versions prior to 21.1R3-S2-EVO; 21.2-EVO versions prior to 21.2R3-S2-EVO; 21.3-EVO versions prior to 21.3R3-EVO; 21.4-EVO versions prior to 21.4R1-S1-EVO, 21.4R2-EVO. This issue does not affect Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved versions prior to 21.1R1-EVO.",
