    "description": "Unspecified vulnerability in the Oracle Outside In Technology component in Oracle Fusion Middleware 8.5.0, 8.5.1, and 8.5.2 allows local users to affect availability via unknown vectors related to Outside In Filters, a different vulnerability than CVE-2015-4808, CVE-2015-6013, CVE-2015-6015, and CVE-2016-0432.  NOTE: the previous information is from the January 2016 CPU. Oracle has not commented on third-party claims that this issue is a stack-based buffer overflow in Oracle Outside In 8.5.2 and earlier, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted DOC file.",
