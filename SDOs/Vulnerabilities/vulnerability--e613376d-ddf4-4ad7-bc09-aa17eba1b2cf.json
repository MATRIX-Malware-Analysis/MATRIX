    "description": "Multiple vulnerabilities in the Media Gateway Control Protocol (MGCP) inspection feature of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. The vulnerabilities are due to inefficient memory management. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending crafted MGCP packets through an affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause memory exhaustion resulting in a restart of an affected device, causing a DoS condition for traffic traversing the device.",
