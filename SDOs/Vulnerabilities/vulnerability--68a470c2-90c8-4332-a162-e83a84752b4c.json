    "description": "Windows Logon Integration feature of F5 BIG-IP APM client prior to version 7.1.7.1 for Windows by default uses Legacy logon mode which uses a SYSTEM account to establish network access. This feature displays a certificate user interface dialog box which contains the link to the certificate policy. By clicking on the link, unprivileged users can open additional dialog boxes and get access to the local machine windows explorer which can be used to get administrator privilege. Windows Logon Integration is vulnerable when the APM client is installed by an administrator on a user machine. Users accessing the local machine can get administrator privileges",
