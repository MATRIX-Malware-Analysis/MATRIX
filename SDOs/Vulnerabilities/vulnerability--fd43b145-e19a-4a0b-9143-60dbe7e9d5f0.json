    "description": "The Go Pricing - WordPress Responsive Pricing Tables plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the 'process_postdata' function in versions up to, and including, 3.3.19. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with a role that the administrator previously granted access to the plugin to modify access to the plugin when it should only be the administrator's privilege.",
