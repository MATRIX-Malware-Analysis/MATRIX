    "description": "An issue was discovered in Nokia NetAct 22 through the Site Configuration Tool website section. A malicious user can change a filename of an uploaded file to include JavaScript code, which is then stored and executed by a victim's web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to victims. Here, the /netact/sct filename parameter is used.",
