    "description": "Barracuda Web Filter 7.x and 8.x before 8.1.0.005, when SSL Inspection is enabled, uses the same root Certification Authority certificate across different customers' installations, which makes it easier for remote attackers to conduct man-in-the-middle attacks against SSL sessions by leveraging the certificate's trust relationship.",
