    "description": "MailEnable Enterprise Premium 10.23 did not use appropriate access control checks in a number of areas. As a result, it was possible to perform a number of actions, when logged in as a user, that that user should not have had permission to perform. It was also possible to gain access to areas within the application for which the accounts used were supposed to have insufficient access.",
