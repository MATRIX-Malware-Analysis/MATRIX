    "description": "A vulnerability in Cisco Unified Communications Manager (Unified CM), Cisco Unified Communications Manager Session Management Edition (Unified CM SME), and Cisco Unity Connection could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to perform a timing attack. This vulnerability is due to insufficient protection of a system password. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by observing the time it takes the system to respond to various queries. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to determine a sensitive system password.",
