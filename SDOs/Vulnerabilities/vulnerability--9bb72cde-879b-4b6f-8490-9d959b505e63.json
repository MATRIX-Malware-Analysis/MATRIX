    "description": "If temporary \"one-time\" permissions, such as the ability to use the Camera, were granted to a document loaded using a file: URL, that permission persisted in that tab for all other documents loaded from a file: URL. This is potentially dangerous if the local files came from different sources, such as in a download directory. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 111.",
