    "description": "A vulnerability in the CLI of Cisco SDWAN vManage Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to delete arbitrary files.\r\n\r This vulnerability is due to improper filtering of directory traversal character sequences within system commands. An attacker with administrative privileges could exploit this vulnerability by running a system command containing directory traversal character sequences to target an arbitrary file. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to delete arbitrary files from the system, including files owned by root.",
