    "description": "An issue has been identified in the CTX269106 mitigation tool for Citrix ShareFile storage zones controller which causes the ShareFile file encryption option to become disabled if it had previously been enabled. Customers are only affected by this issue if they previously selected \u201cEnable Encryption\u201d in the ShareFile configuration page and did not re-select this setting after running the CTX269106 mitigation tool. ShareFile customers who have not run the CTX269106 mitigation tool or who re-selected \u201cEnable Encryption\u201d immediately after running the tool are unaffected by this issue.",
