    "description": "The fix for CVE-2023-24998 was incomplete for Apache Tomcat 11.0.0-M2 to 11.0.0-M4, 10.1.5 to 10.1.7, 9.0.71 to 9.0.73 and 8.5.85 to 8.5.87. If non-default HTTP       connector settings were used such that the maxParameterCount\u00a0could be reached using query string parameters and a request was       submitted that supplied exactly maxParameterCount parameters\u00a0in the query string, the limit for uploaded request parts could be\u00a0bypassed with the potential for a denial of service to occur.\n\n\n\n\n",
