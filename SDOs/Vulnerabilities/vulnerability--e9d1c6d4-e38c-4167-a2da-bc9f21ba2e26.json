    "name": "Weak password requirements in Kiwi TCMS",
    "description": "Kiwi TCMS is an open source test management system. In version 11.6 and prior, when users register new accounts and/or change passwords, there is no validation in place which would prevent them from picking an easy to guess password. This issue is resolved by providing defaults for the `AUTH_PASSWORD_VALIDATORS` configuration setting. As of version 11.7, the password can\u2019t be too similar to other personal information, must contain at least 10 characters, can\u2019t be a commonly used password, and can\u2019t be entirely numeric. As a workaround, an administrator may reset all passwords in Kiwi TCMS if they think a weak password may have been chosen. ",
