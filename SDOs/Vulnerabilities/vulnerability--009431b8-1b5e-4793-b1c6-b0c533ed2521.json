    "description": "A vulnerability in the database user privileges of Cisco Unified Communications Manager (Unified CM), Cisco Unified Communications Manager Session Management Edition (Unified CM SME), and Cisco Unified Communications Manager IM &amp; Presence Service (Unified CM IM&amp;P) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to read arbitrary files on the underlying operating system of an affected device. This vulnerability is due to insufficient file permission restrictions. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted command from the API to the application. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to read arbitrary files on the underlying operating system of the affected device. The attacker would need valid user credentials to exploit this vulnerability.",
