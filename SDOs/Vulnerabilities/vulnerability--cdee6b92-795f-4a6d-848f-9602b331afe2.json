    "description": "AWS data.all is an open source development framework to help users build a data marketplace on Amazon Web Services. data.all versions 1.2.0 through 1.5.1 do not prevent remote code execution when a user injects Python commands into the \u2018Template\u2019 field when configuring a data pipeline.
