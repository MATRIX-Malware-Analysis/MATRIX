    "description": "Barco MirrorOp Windows Sender before 2.5.3.65 uses cleartext HTTP and thus allows rogue software upgrades. An attacker on the local network can achieve remote code execution on any computer that tries to update Windows Sender due to the fact that the upgrade mechanism is not secured (is not protected with TLS).",
