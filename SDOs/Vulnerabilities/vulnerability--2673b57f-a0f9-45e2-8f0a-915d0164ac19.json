    "description": "A vulnerability in the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) implementation in Cisco ASR 920 Series Aggregation Services Router model ASR920-12SZ-IM could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to cause the device to reload. The vulnerability is due to incorrect handling of data that is returned for Cisco Discovery Protocol queries to SNMP. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a request for Cisco Discovery Protocol information by using SNMP. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.",
