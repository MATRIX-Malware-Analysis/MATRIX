CMR2040 (All versions < V2.2), SIMATIC RTU3010C (All versions < V4.0.9), SIMATIC RTU3030C (All versions < V4.0.9), SIMATIC RTU3031C (All versions < V4.0.9), SIMATIC RTU3041C (All versions < V4.0.9). The underlying TCP/IP stack does not properly calculate the random numbers used as ISN (Initial Sequence Numbers). An adjacent attacker with network access to the LAN interface could interfere with traffic, spoof the connection and gain access to sensitive information.",
