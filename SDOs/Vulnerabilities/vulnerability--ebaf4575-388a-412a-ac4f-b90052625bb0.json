    "description": "A vulnerability in the Hot Standby Router Protocol (HSRP) subsystem of Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to receive potentially sensitive information from an affected device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient memory initialization. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by receiving HSRPv2 traffic from an adjacent HSRP member. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to receive potentially sensitive information from the adjacent device.",
