    "description": "Nextcloud Server provides data storage for Nextcloud, an open source cloud platform. Starting in version 25.0.0 and prior to versions 25.0.13, 26.0.8, and 27.1.3 of Nextcloud Server and Nextcloud Enterprise Server, when a user is tricked into copy pasting HTML code without markup (Ctrl+Shift+V) the markup will actually render. Nextcloud Server and Nextcloud Enterprise Server versions 25.0.13, 26.0.8, and 27.1.3 contain a fix for this issue. As a workaround, disable app text.",
