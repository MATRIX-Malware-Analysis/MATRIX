    "description": "DLL hijacking is possible in Sublime Text 3 version 3.1.1 build 3176 on 32-bit Windows platforms because a Trojan horse api-ms-win-core-fibers-l1-1-1.dll or api-ms-win-core-localization-l1-2-1.dll file may be loaded if a victim uses sublime_text.exe to open a .txt file within an attacker's %LOCALAPPDATA%\\Temp\\sublime_text folder. NOTE: the vendor's position is \"This does not appear to be a bug with Sublime Text, but rather one with Windows that has been patched.",
