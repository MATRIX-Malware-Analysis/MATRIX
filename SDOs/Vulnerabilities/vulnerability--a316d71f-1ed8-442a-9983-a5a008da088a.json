    "description": "An untrusted search path vulnerability exists in the Palo Alto Networks Cortex XDR agent that enables a local attacker with file creation privilege in the Windows root directory (such as C:\\) to store a program that can then be unintentionally executed by another local user when that user utilizes a Live Terminal session. This issue impacts: Cortex XDR agent 5.0 versions earlier than Cortex XDR agent 5.0.12; Cortex XDR agent 6.1 versions earlier than Cortex XDR agent 6.1.9; Cortex XDR agent 7.2 versions earlier than Cortex XDR agent 7.2.4; Cortex XDR agent 7.3 versions earlier than Cortex XDR agent 7.3.2.",
