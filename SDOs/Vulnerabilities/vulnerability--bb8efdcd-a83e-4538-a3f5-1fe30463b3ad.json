    "description": "A Remote Code Execution vulnerability in lmgrd and vendor daemon components of FlexNet Publisher version 11.16.1.0 and earlier could allow a remote attacker to corrupt the memory by allocating / deallocating memory, loading lmgrd or the vendor daemon and causing the heartbeat between lmgrd and the vendor daemon to stop. This would force the vendor daemon to shut down. No exploit of this vulnerability has been demonstrated.",
