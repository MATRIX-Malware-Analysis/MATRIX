    "description": "The WordPress Contact Forms by Cimatti plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.5.7. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the function _accua_forms_form_edit_action. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete forms created with this plugin via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
