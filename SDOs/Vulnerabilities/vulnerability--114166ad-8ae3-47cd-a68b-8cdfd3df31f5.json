    "description": "The Device Encryption Client component in Sophos SafeGuard Enterprise 6.0, when a volume-based encryption policy is enabled in conjunction with a user-defined key, does not properly block use of exFAT USB flash drives, which makes it easier for local users to bypass intended access restrictions and copy sensitive information to a drive via multiple removal and reattach operations.",
