    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Inductive Automation Ignition 8.1.15 (b2022030114). User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the processing of ZIP files. Crafted data in a ZIP file can cause the application to execute arbitrary Python scripts. The user interface fails to provide sufficient indication of the hazard. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of SYSTEM. Was ZDI-CAN-16949.",
