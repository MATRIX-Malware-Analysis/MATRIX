    "description": "A vulnerability in the web interface of Cisco Network Analysis Module Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to delete arbitrary files from an affected system, aka Directory Traversal. The vulnerability exists because the affected software does not perform proper input validation of HTTP requests that it receives and the software does not apply role-based access controls (RBACs) to requested HTTP URLs. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to the affected software. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to delete arbitrary files from the affected system. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvf41365.",
