    "name": "Cisco IOS XE Software Virtual Fragmentation Reassembly Denial of Service Vulnerability",
    "description": "A vulnerability in the implementation of the IPv4 Virtual Fragmentation Reassembly (VFR) feature of Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. This vulnerability is due to improper reassembly of large packets that occurs when VFR is enabled on either a tunnel interface or on a physical interface that is configured with a maximum transmission unit (MTU) greater than 4,615 bytes. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending fragmented packets through a VFR-enabled interface on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition.",
