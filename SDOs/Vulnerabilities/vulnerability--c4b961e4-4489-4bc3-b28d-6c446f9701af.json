    "description": "The DBCPConnectionPool and HikariCPConnectionPool Controller Services in Apache NiFi 0.0.2 through 1.21.0 allow an authenticated and authorized user to configure a Database URL with the H2 driver that enables custom code execution.\n\nThe resolution validates the Database URL and rejects H2 JDBC locations.\n\nYou are recommended to upgrade to version 1.22.0 or later which fixes this issue.\n\n\n",
