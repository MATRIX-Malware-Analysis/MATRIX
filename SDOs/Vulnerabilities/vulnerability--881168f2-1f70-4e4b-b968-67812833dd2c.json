    "description": "An unauthenticated user can attach to an open interface exposed through JNDI by the Messaging System of SAP NetWeaver Process Integration (PI) - version 7.50. This user can make use of an open naming and directory API to access services that could perform unauthorized operations. The vulnerability affects local users and data, leading to a considerable impact on confidentiality as well as availability and a limited impact on the integrity of the application. These operations can be used to:\n\n  *  Read any information\n  *  Modify sensitive information\n  *  Denial of Service attacks (DoS)\n  *  SQL Injection\n\n\n\n\n",
