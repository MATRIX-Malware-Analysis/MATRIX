    "description": "An issue was discovered in slicer69 doas before 6.2 on certain platforms other than OpenBSD. A setusercontext(3) call with flags to change the UID, primary GID, and secondary GIDs was replaced (on certain platforms: Linux and possibly NetBSD) with a single setuid(2) call. This resulted in neither changing the group id nor initializing secondary group ids.",
