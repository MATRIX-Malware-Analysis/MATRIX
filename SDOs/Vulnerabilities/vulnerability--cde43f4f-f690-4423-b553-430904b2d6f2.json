    "description": "An issue was discovered on Tenda AC7 devices with firmware through V15.03.06.44_CN(AC7), AC9 devices with firmware through V15.03.05.19(6318)_CN(AC9), and AC10 devices with firmware through V15.03.06.23_CN(AC10). A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the router's web server (httpd). When processing the list parameters for a post request, the value is directly written with sprintf to a local variable placed on the stack, which overrides the return address of the function, causing a buffer overflow.",
