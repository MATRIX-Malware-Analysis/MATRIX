    "description": "A vulnerability in the implementation of the Cisco Network Plug-and-Play (PnP) agent of Cisco DNA Center could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to view sensitive information in clear text. The attacker must have valid low-privileged user credentials. This vulnerability is due to improper role-based access control (RBAC) with the integration of PnP. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the device and sending a query to an internal API. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view sensitive information in clear text, which could include configuration files.",
