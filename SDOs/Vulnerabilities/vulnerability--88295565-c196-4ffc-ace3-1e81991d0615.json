    "name": "Junos OS: Insufficient validation of environment variables in telnet client may lead to stack-based buffer overflow",
    "description": "Insufficient validation of environment variables in the telnet client supplied in Junos OS can lead to stack-based buffer overflows, which can be exploited to bypass veriexec restrictions on Junos OS. A stack-based overflow is present in the handling of environment variables when connecting via the telnet client to remote telnet servers. This issue only affects the telnet client \u2014 accessible from the CLI or shell \u2014 in Junos OS. Inbound telnet services are not affected by this issue.
