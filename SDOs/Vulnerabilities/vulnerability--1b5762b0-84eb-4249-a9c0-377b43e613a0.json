    "description": "An HTTP Packet Processing vulnerability in the Web Bridge interface of the Cisco Meeting Server (CMS), formerly Acano Conferencing Server, could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to retrieve memory contents, which could lead to the disclosure of confidential information. In addition, the attacker could potentially cause the application to crash unexpectedly, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. The attacker would need to be authenticated and have a valid session with the Web Bridge. Affected Products: This vulnerability affects Cisco Meeting Server software releases prior to 2.1.2. This product was previously known as Acano Conferencing Server. More Information: CSCvc89551. Known Affected Releases: 2.0 2.0.7 2.1. Known Fixed Releases: 2.1.2.",
