    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Foxit PhantomPDF 9.6.0.25114. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the processing of script within a Keystroke action of a listbox field. The issue results from the lack of validating the existence of an object prior to performing operations on the object.
