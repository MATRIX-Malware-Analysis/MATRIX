    "description": "The Chained Quiz plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.3.2.4. This is due to missing nonce validation on the list_quizzes() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete quizzes and copy quizzes via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
