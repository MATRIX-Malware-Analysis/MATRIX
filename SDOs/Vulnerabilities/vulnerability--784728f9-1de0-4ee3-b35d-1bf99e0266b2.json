    "description": "A vulnerability in the deep packet inspection (DPI) engine of Cisco SD-WAN vEdge Routers could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected system. The vulnerability is due to insufficient handling of malformed packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted packets through an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to reboot, resulting in a DoS condition.",
