    "description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Integrated Management Controller (IMC) Supervisor, Cisco UCS Director, and Cisco UCS Director Express for Big Data could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to a missing authentication check in an API call. An attacker who can send a request to an affected system could cause all currently authenticated users to be logged off. Repeated exploitation could cause the inability to maintain a session in the web-based management portal.",
