    "description": "An issue was discovered in Adobe Acrobat and Reader: 2017.012.20098 and earlier versions, 2017.011.30066 and earlier versions, 2015.006.30355 and earlier versions, and 11.0.22 and earlier versions. This vulnerability is an instance of a type confusion vulnerability in the EMF processing module. The issue causes the program to access an object using an incompatible type, leading to an out of bounds memory access. Attackers can exploit the vulnerability by using the out of bounds access for unintended reads, writes, or frees -- potentially leading to code corruption, control-flow hijack, or information leak attack.",
