    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Foxit Reader 8.3.1.21155. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the formNodes method of XFA Node objects. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a type confusion condition. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code under the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-5018.",
