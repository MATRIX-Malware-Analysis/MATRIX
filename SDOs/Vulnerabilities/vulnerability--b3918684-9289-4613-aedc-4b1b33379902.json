    "description": "A vulnerability in the Tool Command Language (Tcl) interpreter of Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker with privileged EXEC credentials to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected system. The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of data passed to the Tcl interpreter. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by executing crafted Tcl arguments on an affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition.",
