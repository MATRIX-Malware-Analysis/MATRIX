    "description": "A vulnerability in the packet processing functionality of Cisco Embedded Wireless Controller (EWC) Software for Catalyst Access Points (APs) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected AP. This vulnerability is due to insufficient buffer allocation. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted traffic to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to exhaust available resources and cause a DoS condition on an affected AP, as well as a DoS condition for client traffic traversing the AP.",
