    "description": "The \"spiffy-cgi-handlers\" egg would convert a nonexistent \"Proxy\" header to the HTTP_PROXY environment variable, which would allow attackers to direct CGI programs which use this environment variable to use an attacker-specified HTTP proxy server (also known as a \"httpoxy\" attack). This affects all versions of spiffy-cgi-handlers before 0.5.",
