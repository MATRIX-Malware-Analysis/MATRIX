    "name": "Improper Authentication in Volto",
    "description": "Volto is a ReactJS-based frontend for the Plone Content Management System. Between versions 14.0.0-alpha.5 and 15.0.0-alpha.0, a user could have their authentication cookie replaced with an authentication cookie from another user, effectively giving them control of the other user's account and privileges. This occurs when using an outdated version of the `react-cookie` library and a server is under high load. A proof of concept does not currently exist, but it is possible for this issue to occur in the wild. The patch and fix is present in Volto 15.0.0-alpha.0. As a workaround, one may manually upgrade the `react-cookie` package to 4.1.1 and then override all Volto components that use this library.",
