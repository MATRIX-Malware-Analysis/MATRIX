    "description": "Synchrony deobfuscator is a javascript cleaner & deobfuscator.  A `__proto__` pollution vulnerability exists in versions before v2.4.4. Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution. A `__proto__` pollution vulnerability exists in the `LiteralMap` transformer allowing crafted input to modify properties in the Object prototype. A fix has been released in `deobfuscator@2.4.4`. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should launch node with the [--disable-proto=delete][disable-proto] or [--disable-proto=throw][disable-proto] flags\n",
