    "description": "A vulnerability has been identified in Solid Edge SE2020 (All versions < SE2020MP13), Solid Edge SE2020 (All versions < SE2020MP14), Solid Edge SE2021 (All Versions < SE2021MP4). Affected applications lack proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing PAR files. This could lead to pointer dereferences of a value obtained from untrusted source. An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. (ZDI-CAN-11919)",
