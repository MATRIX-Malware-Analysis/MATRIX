    "name": "Cisco IoT Field Network Director TLS Renegotiation Denial of Service Vulnerability",
    "description": "A vulnerability in the web interface of Cisco IoT Field Network Director could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to trigger high CPU usage, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to improper handling of Transport Layer Security (TLS) renegotiation requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending renegotiation requests at a high rate. A successful exploit could increase the resource usage on the system, eventually leading to a DoS condition.",
