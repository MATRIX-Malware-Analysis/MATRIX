    "description": "Revive Adserver before 3.2.3 suffers from session fixation, by allowing arbitrary session identifiers to be forced and, at the same time, by not invalidating the existing session upon a successful authentication. Under some circumstances, that could have been an opportunity for an attacker to steal an authenticated session.",
