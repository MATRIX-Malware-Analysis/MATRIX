    "description": "A vulnerability in the vContainer of the Cisco SD-WAN Solution could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition and execute arbitrary code as the root user. The vulnerability is due to improper bounds checking by the vContainer. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious file to an affected vContainer instance. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a buffer overflow condition on the affected vContainer, which could result in a DoS condition that the attacker could use to execute arbitrary code as the root user.",
