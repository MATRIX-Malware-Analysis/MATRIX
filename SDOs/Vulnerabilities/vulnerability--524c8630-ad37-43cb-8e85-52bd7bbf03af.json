    "description": "This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of NETGEAR Orbi 2.5.1.16 routers. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the UA_Parser utility. A crafted Host Name option in a DHCP request can trigger execution of a system call composed from a user-supplied string. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of root. Was ZDI-CAN-11076.",
