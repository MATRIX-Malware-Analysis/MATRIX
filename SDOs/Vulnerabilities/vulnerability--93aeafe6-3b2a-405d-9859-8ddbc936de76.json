    "description": "A vulnerability in the SOAP API endpoint of Cisco Unified Communications Manager, Cisco Unified Communications Manager Session Management Edition, Cisco Unified Communications Manager IM &amp; Presence Service, Cisco Unity Connection, and Cisco Prime License Manager could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on an affected device. This vulnerability is due to improper sanitization of user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a SOAP API request with crafted parameters to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code with root privileges on the underlying Linux operating system of the affected device.",
