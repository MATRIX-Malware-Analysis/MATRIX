    "description": "GE Healthcare Optima MR360 does not require authentication for the HIPAA emergency login procedure, which allows physically proximate users to gain access via an arbitrary username in the Emergency Login screen.  NOTE: this might not qualify for inclusion in CVE if unauthenticated emergency access is part of the intended security policy of the product, can be controlled by the system administrator, and is not enabled by default.",
