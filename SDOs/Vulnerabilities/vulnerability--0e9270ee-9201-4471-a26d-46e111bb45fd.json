    "description": "Check Point Endpoint Security Client for Windows before version E84.20 allows write access to the directory from which the installation repair takes place. Since the MS Installer allows regular users to run the repair, an attacker can initiate the installation repair and place a specially crafted DLL in the repair folder which will run with the Endpoint client\u2019s privileges.",
