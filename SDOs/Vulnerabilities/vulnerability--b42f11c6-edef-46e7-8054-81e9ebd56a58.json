    "description": "Apache Airflow SMTP Provider before 1.3.0, Apache Airflow IMAP Provider before 3.3.0, and\u00a0Apache Airflow before 2.7.0 are affected by the\u00a0Validation of OpenSSL Certificate vulnerability.\n\nThe default SSL context with SSL library did not check a server's X.509\u00a0certificate.\u00a0 Instead, the code accepted any certificate, which could\u00a0result in the disclosure of mail server credentials or mail contents\u00a0when the client connects to an attacker in a MITM position.\n\nUsers are strongly advised to upgrade to Apache Airflow version 2.7.0 or newer, Apache Airflow IMAP Provider version 3.3.0 or newer, and Apache Airflow SMTP Provider version 1.3.0 or newer to mitigate the risk associated with this vulnerability",
