    "description": "A vulnerability in the sponsor portal web interface for Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to impact the integrity of an affected system by executing arbitrary SQL queries. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted input that includes SQL statements to an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to modify entries in some database tables, affecting the integrity of the data. At the time of publication, this vulnerability affected Cisco ISE running software releases 2.6.0 and prior.",
