    "description": "IBM has identified a vulnerability with IBM Spectrum Scale/GPFS utilized on the Elastic Storage Server (ESS)/GPFS Storage Server (GSS) during testing of an unsupported configuration, where users applications are running on an active ESS I/O server node and utilize direct I/O to perform a read or a write to a Spectrum Scale file. This vulnerability may result in the use of an incorrect memory address, leading to a Spectrum Scale/GPFS daemon failure with a Signal 11, and possibly leading to denial of service or undetected data corruption.
