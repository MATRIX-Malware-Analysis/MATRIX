    "description": "On versions 15.0.x before 15.1.0 and 14.1.x before 14.1.4, the BIG-IP system provides an option to connect HTTP/2 clients to HTTP/1.x servers. When a client is slow to accept responses and it closes a connection prematurely, the BIG-IP system may indefinitely retain some streams unclosed. Note: Software versions which have reached End of Software Development (EoSD) are not evaluated.",
