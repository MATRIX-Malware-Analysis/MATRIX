    "description": "A vulnerability in the remote access SSL VPN features of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. This vulnerability is due to improper validation of errors that are logged as a result of client connections that are made using remote access VPN. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted requests to an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to restart, resulting in a DoS condition.",
