    "description": "\n\n\nIn WS_FTP Server versions prior to 8.7.4 and 8.8.2, a directory traversal vulnerability was discovered.\u00a0 An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to perform file operations (delete, rename, rmdir, mkdir) on files and folders outside of their authorized WS_FTP folder path.\u00a0 Attackers could also escape the context of the WS_FTP Server file structure and perform the same level of operations (delete, rename, rmdir, mkdir) on file and folder locations on the underlying operating system.\n",
