    "name": "Cacti Privilege Escalation",
    "description": "Cacti is an open source operational monitoring and fault management framework. Affected versions are subject to a privilege escalation vulnerability. A low-privileged OS user with access to a Windows host where Cacti is installed can create arbitrary PHP files in a web document directory. The user can then execute the PHP files under the security context of SYSTEM. This allows an attacker to escalate privilege from a normal user account to SYSTEM. This issue has been addressed in version 1.2.25. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.\n",
