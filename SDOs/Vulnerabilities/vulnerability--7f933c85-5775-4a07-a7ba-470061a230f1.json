    "description": "The Languages selection in the admin interface in Kailash Nadh boastMachine (formerly bMachine) 3.1 and earlier allows remote authenticated administrators to upload files with arbitrary extensions to the bmc/Inc/Lang directory.  NOTE: because the uploaded files cannot be accessed through HTTP, this issue is a vulnerability only if there is a likely usage pattern in which the files would be opened or executed by local users, e.g., malware files with names that entice local users to open the files.",
