    "description": "A vulnerability in Cisco NX-OS System Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to bypass signature verification when loading a software patch. The vulnerability is due to insufficient NX-OS signature verification for software patches. An authenticated, local attacker could exploit this vulnerability to bypass signature verification and load a crafted, unsigned software patch on a targeted device. The attacker would need valid administrator credentials to perform this exploit. This vulnerability affects the following products running Cisco NX-OS System Software: Multilayer Director Switches, Nexus 7000 Series Switches, Nexus 7700 Series Switches, Unified Computing System Manager. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvf16494, CSCvf23655.",
