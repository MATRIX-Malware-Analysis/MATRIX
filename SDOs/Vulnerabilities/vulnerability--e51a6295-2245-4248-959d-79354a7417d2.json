    "description": "The Windows Installation component of TIBCO Software Inc.'s TIBCO Messaging - Eclipse Mosquitto Distribution - Core - Community Edition and TIBCO Messaging - Eclipse Mosquitto Distribution - Core - Enterprise Edition contains a vulnerability that theoretically allows a low privileged attacker with local access on some versions of the Windows operating system to insert malicious software. The affected component can be abused to execute the malicious software inserted by the attacker with the elevated privileges of the component. This vulnerability results from a lack of access restrictions on certain files and/or folders in the installation. Affected releases are TIBCO Software Inc.'s TIBCO Messaging - Eclipse Mosquitto Distribution - Core - Community Edition: versions 1.3.0 and below and TIBCO Messaging - Eclipse Mosquitto Distribution - Core - Enterprise Edition: versions 1.3.0 and below.",
