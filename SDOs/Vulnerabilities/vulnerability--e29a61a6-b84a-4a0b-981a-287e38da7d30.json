    "description": "This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected D-Link DIR-2150 4.0.1 routers. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the anweb service, which listens on TCP ports 80 and 443 by default. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of root. Was ZDI-CAN-15728.",
