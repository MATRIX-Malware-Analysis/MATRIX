    "name": "Cisco IOS XE Software Raw Socket Transport Denial of Service Vulnerability",
    "description": "A vulnerability in the Raw Socket Transport feature of Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to trigger a reload of an affected device, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to improper parsing of Raw Socket Transport payloads. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by establishing a TCP session and then sending a malicious TCP segment via IPv4 to an affected device. This cannot be exploited via IPv6, as the Raw Socket Transport feature does not support IPv6 as a network layer protocol.",
