    "description": "An issue was discovered in lib_mem.c in Micrium uC/OS uC/LIB 1.38.x and 1.39.00. The following memory allocation functions do not check for integer overflow when allocating a pool whose size exceeds the address space: Mem_PoolCreate, Mem_DynPoolCreate, and Mem_DynPoolCreateHW. Because these functions use multiplication to calculate the pool sizes, the operation may cause an integer overflow if the arguments are large enough. The resulting memory pool will be smaller than expected and may be exploited by an attacker.",
