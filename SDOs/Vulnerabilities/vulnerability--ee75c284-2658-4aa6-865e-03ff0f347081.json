    "description": "A hard-link created from log file archive of Check Point ZoneAlarm up to 15.4.062 or Check Point Endpoint Security client for Windows before E80.96 to any file on the system will get its permission changed so that all users can access that linked file. Doing this on files with limited access gains the local attacker higher privileges to the file.",
