By uploading an SVG file with an html extension the upload filter can be bypassed. This causes Stored XSS. Also, after uploading a file the XSS attack is triggered upon a user viewing the file. Through this vulnerability, an attacker is capable to execute malicious scripts. Users are advised to update as soon as possible.",
