    "name": "Junos OS: SRX Series: The flow processing daemon (flowd) will crash when Unified Policies are used with IPv6 and certain dynamic applications are rejected by the device",
    "description": "An Out-of-Bounds Write vulnerability in Flow Processing Daemon (flowd) of Juniper Networks Junos OS allows an unauthenticated, network-based attacker to cause Denial of Service (DoS). On SRX Series devices using Unified Policies with IPv6, when a specific IPv6 packet goes through a dynamic-application filter which will generate an ICMP deny message, the flowd core is observed and the PFE is restarted. This issue affects: Juniper Networks Junos OS on SRX Series: 19.2 versions prior to 19.2R3-S6; 19.3 versions prior to 19.3R3-S6; 19.4 versions prior to 19.4R3-S9; 20.2 versions prior to 20.2R3-S5; 20.3 versions prior to 20.3R3-S4; 20.4 versions prior to 20.4R3-S3; 21.1 versions prior to 21.1R3; 21.2 versions prior to 21.2R3; 21.3 versions prior to 21.3R2; 21.4 versions prior to 21.4R2.",
