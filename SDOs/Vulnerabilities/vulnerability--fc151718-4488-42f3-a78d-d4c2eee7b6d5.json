    "name": "Cisco Policy Suite Graphite Unauthenticated Read-Only Access Vulnerability",
    "description": "A vulnerability in the Graphite web interface of the Policy and Charging Rules Function (PCRF) of Cisco Policy Suite (CPS) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to access the Graphite web interface. The attacker would need to have access to the internal VLAN where CPS is deployed. The vulnerability is due to lack of authentication. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by directly connecting to the Graphite web interface. An exploit could allow the attacker to access various statistics and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) regarding the Cisco Policy Suite environment.",
