    "name": "Rockwell Automation Enhanced HIM Vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery Attack",
    "description": "The Rockwell Automation Enhanced HIM software contains \n\nan API that the application uses that is not protected sufficiently and uses incorrect Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) settings and, as a result, is vulnerable to a Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attack. To exploit this vulnerability, a malicious user would have to convince a user to click on an untrusted link through a social engineering attack or successfully perform a Cross Site Scripting Attack (XSS). Exploitation of a CSRF could potentially lead to sensitive information disclosure and full remote access to the affected products.\n\n\n\n\n",
