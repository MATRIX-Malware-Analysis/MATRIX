    "description": "RubyGems is a package registry used to supply software for the Ruby language ecosystem. An ordering mistake in the code that accepts gem uploads allowed some gems (with platforms ending in numbers, like `arm64-darwin-21`) to be temporarily replaced in the CDN cache by a malicious package. The bug has been patched, and is believed to have never been exploited, based on an extensive review of logs and existing gems by rubygems. The easiest way to ensure that an application has not been exploited by this vulnerability is to verify all downloaded .gems checksums match the checksum recorded in the RubyGems.org database. RubyGems.org has been patched and is no longer vulnerable to this issue.",
