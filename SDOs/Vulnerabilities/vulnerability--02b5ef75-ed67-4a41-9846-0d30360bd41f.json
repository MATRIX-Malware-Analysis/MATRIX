    "description": "A vulnerability in Sierra Wireless AirLink GX400, GX440, ES440, and LS300 routers with firmware before 4.4.5 and GX450, ES450, RV50, RV50X, MP70, and MP70E routers with firmware before 4.9 could allow an authenticated remote attacker to execute arbitrary code and gain full control of an affected system, including issuing commands with root privileges. This vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation on user-controlled input in an HTTP request to the targeted device. An attacker in possession of router login credentials could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to an affected system.",
