    "description": "IBM Lotus Notes 6.0, 6.5, and 7.0 does not properly handle replies to e-mail messages with alternate name users when the (1) \"Save As Draft\" option is used or (2) a \",\" (comma) is inside the \"phrase\" portion of an address, which can cause the e-mail to be sent to users that were deleted from the To, CC, and BCC fields, which allows remote attackers to obtain the list of original recipients.",
