    "description": "Buffer overflow in KarjaSoft Sami FTP Server 2.0.x allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (daemon crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a long argument to an arbitrary command, which triggers the overflow when the SamyFtp.binlog log file is viewed in the management console.  NOTE: this may overlap CVE-2006-0441 and CVE-2006-2212.",
