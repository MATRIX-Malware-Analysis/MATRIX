    "description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business 300 Series Managed Switches could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the interface of an affected system. The vulnerability exists because the affected management interface performs insufficient validation of user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a malicious link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or allow the attacker to access sensitive, browser-based information.",
