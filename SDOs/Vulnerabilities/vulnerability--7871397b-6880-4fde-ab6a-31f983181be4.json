    "name": "Stored Cross-site Scripting in reports_admin.php through Device-Name in 'select' input in Cacti",
    "description": "Cacti is an open source operational monitoring and fault management framework. Affected versions are subject to a Stored Cross-Site-Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability allows an authenticated user to poison data stored in the _cacti_'s database. These data will be viewed by administrative _cacti_ accounts and execute JavaScript code in the victim's browser at view-time. The`reports_admin.php` script displays reporting information about graphs, devices, data sources etc.\nCENSUS found that an adversary that is able to configure a malicious Device name, can deploy a stored XSS attack against any user of the same (or broader) privileges. A user that possesses the _General Administration>Sites/Devices/Data_ permissions can configure the device names in _cacti_. This configuration occurs through `http://<HOST>/cacti/host.php`, while the rendered malicious payload is exhibited at `http://<HOST>/cacti/reports_admin.php` when the a graph with the maliciously altered device name is linked to the report. This vulnerability has been addressed in version 1.2.25. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to update should manually filter HTML output.",
