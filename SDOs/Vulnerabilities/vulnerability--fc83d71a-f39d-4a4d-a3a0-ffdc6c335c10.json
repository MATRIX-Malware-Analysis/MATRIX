    "description": "res_pjsip_t38 in Sangoma Asterisk 16.x before 16.16.2, 17.x before 17.9.3, and 18.x before 18.2.2, and Certified Asterisk before 16.8-cert7, allows an attacker to trigger a crash by sending an m=image line and zero port in a response to a T.38 re-invite initiated by Asterisk. This is a re-occurrence of the CVE-2019-15297 symptoms but not for exactly the same reason. The crash occurs because there is an append operation relative to the active topology, but this should instead be a replace operation.",
