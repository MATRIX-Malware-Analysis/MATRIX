    "description": "The tf_remapper_node component 1.1.1 for Robot Operating System (ROS) allows attackers, who control the source code of a different node in the same ROS application, to change a robot's behavior. This occurs because a topic name depends on the attacker-controlled old_tf_topic_name and/or new_tf_topic_name parameter. NOTE: the vendor's position is \"it is the responsibility of the programmer to make sure that only known and required parameters are set and unexpected parameters are not.\"",
