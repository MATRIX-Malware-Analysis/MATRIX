    "description": "A vulnerability in Cisco Jabber for Windows could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code. The vulnerability is due to improper validation of message contents. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending specially crafted Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) messages to the affected software. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the application to execute arbitrary programs on the targeted system with the privileges of the user account that is running the Cisco Jabber client software, possibly resulting in arbitrary code execution.",
