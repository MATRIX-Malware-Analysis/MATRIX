    "description": "Multiple products that implement the IP Encapsulation within IP standard (RFC 2003, STD 1) decapsulate and route IP-in-IP traffic without any validation, which could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to route arbitrary traffic via an exposed network interface and lead to spoofing, access control bypass, and other unexpected network behaviors.",
