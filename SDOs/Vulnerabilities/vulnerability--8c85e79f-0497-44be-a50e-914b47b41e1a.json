    "description": "Password recovery vulnerability in SICK SIM2000ST Partnumber 1080579 allows an unprivileged remote attacker to gain access to the userlevel defined as RecoverableUserLevel by invocating the password recovery mechanism method. This leads to an increase in their privileges on the system and thereby affecting the confidentiality integrity and availability of the system. An attacker can expect repeatable success by exploiting the vulnerability. The firmware versions <=1.7.0 allow to optionally disable device configuration over the network interfaces. Please make sure that you apply general security practices when operating the SIM2000ST. A fix is planned but not yet scheduled.",
