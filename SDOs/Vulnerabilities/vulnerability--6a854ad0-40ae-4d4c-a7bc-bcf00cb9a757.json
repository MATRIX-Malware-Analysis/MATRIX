    "description": "captcha.php in BellaBook (aka BellaBuffs) allows remote attackers to obtain administrative privileges by sending the admin's username (admin_name) in a pheap_login cookie.  NOTE: the vendor disputes this vulnerability because authentication data is derived from the admin_pass and secret variables, in addition to the admin_name; and because the exploit code is designed for an unrelated application",
