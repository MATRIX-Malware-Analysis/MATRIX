    "name": "Crashes due to overflow and `CHECK`-fail in ops with large tensor shapes",
    "description": "TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. In affected versions TensorFlow allows tensor to have a large number of dimensions and each dimension can be as large as desired. However, the total number of elements in a tensor must fit within an `int64_t`. If an overflow occurs, `MultiplyWithoutOverflow` would return a negative result. In the majority of TensorFlow codebase this then results in a `CHECK`-failure. Newer constructs exist which return a `Status` instead of crashing the binary. This is similar to CVE-2021-29584. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.7.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.6.1, TensorFlow 2.5.2, and TensorFlow 2.4.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.",
