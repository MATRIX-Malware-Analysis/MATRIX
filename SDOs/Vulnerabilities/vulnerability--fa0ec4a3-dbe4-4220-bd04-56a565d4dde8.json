    "description": "Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Oracle Application Express (formerly HTML DB) before 2.2.1 allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary HTML or web script via the WWV_FLOW_ITEM_HELP package.  NOTE: it is likely that this issue overlaps one of the Oracle VulnIDs covered by CVE-2006-5351. Oracle has not publicly disputed claims by a reliable researcher that this has been fixed by the October 2006 CPU.",
