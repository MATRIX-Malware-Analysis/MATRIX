    "description": "This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to bypass authentication on affected installations of D-Link DIR-867, DIR-878, and DIR-882 routers with firmware 1.10B04. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the handling of HNAP login requests. The issue results from the lack of proper handling of empty passwords. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on the router. Was ZDI-CAN-9471.",
