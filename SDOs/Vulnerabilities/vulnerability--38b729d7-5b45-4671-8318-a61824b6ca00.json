    "description": "A zip slip vulnerability in XINJE XD/E Series PLC Program Tool up to version v3.5.1 can provide an attacker with arbitrary file write privilege when opening a specially-crafted project file. This vulnerability can be triggered by manually opening an infected project file, or by initiating an upload program request from an infected Xinje PLC. This can result in remote code execution, information disclosure and denial of service of the system running the XINJE XD/E Series PLC Program Tool.",
