    "description": "Little Snitch versions 4.4.0 fixes a vulnerability in a privileged helper tool. However, the operating system may have made a copy of the privileged helper which is not removed or updated immediately. Computers may therefore still be vulnerable after upgrading to 4.4.0. Version 4.4.1 fixes this issue by removing the operating system's copy during the upgrade.",
