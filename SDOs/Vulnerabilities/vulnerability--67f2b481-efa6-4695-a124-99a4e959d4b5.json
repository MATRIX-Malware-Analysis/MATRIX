    "name": "`CHECK` fail in `FakeQuantWithMinMaxVarsPerChannelGradient` in TensorFlow",
    "description": "TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. When `tf.quantization.fake_quant_with_min_max_vars_per_channel_gradient` receives input `min` or `max` of rank other than 1, it gives a `CHECK` fail that can trigger a denial of service attack. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit f3cf67ac5705f4f04721d15e485e192bb319feed. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.10.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.9.1, TensorFlow 2.8.1, and TensorFlow 2.7.2, as these are also affected and still in supported range.There are no known workarounds for this issue.",
