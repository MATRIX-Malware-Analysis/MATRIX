    "description": "An issue was discovered in PhreeBooksERP before 2017-02-13. The vulnerability exists due to insufficient filtration of user-supplied data in the \"form\" HTTP GET parameter passed to the \"PhreeBooksERP-master/extensions/ShippingMethods/ups/label_mgr/js_include.php\" and \"PhreeBooksERP-master/extensions/ShippingMethods/yrc/label_mgr/js_include.php\" URLs. An attacker could execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a browser in the context of the vulnerable website. NOTE: these js_include.php files do not exist in the SourceForge \"stable release\" (aka R37RC1).",
