    "name": "Cisco Wireless LAN Controller Software Session Hijacking Vulnerability",
    "description": "A vulnerability in the session identification management functionality of the web-based interface of Cisco Wireless LAN Controller (WLC) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to hijack a valid user session on an affected system. The vulnerability exists because the affected software does not properly clear previously assigned session identifiers for a user session when a user authenticates to the web-based interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using an existing session identifier to connect to the software through the web-based interface. Successful exploitation could allow the attacker to hijack an authenticated user's browser session on the system. Versions 8.1 and 8.5 are affected.",
