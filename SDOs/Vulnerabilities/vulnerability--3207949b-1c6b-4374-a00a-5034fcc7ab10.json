    "description": "This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to bypass authentication on affected installations of NETGEAR R7000 1.0.11.116_10.2.100 routers. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the processing of SOAP requests. The issue results from the lack of proper authentication verification before performing a password reset. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to reset the admin password. Was ZDI-CAN-13483.",
