    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Sante DICOM Viewer Pro 13.2.0.21165. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the parsing of JP2 files.
