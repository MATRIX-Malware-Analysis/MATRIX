    "description": "Firefox 1.5.0.7 on Kubuntu Linux allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via a long URL in an A tag.  NOTE: this issue has been disputed by several vendors, who could not reproduce the report. In addition, the scope of the impact - system freeze - suggests an issue that is not related to Firefox. Due to this impact, CVE concurs with the dispute",
