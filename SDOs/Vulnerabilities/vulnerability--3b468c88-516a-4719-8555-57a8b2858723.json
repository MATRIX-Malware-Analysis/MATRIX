    "description": "This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to bypass authentication on affected installations of D-Link DIR-867, DIR-878, and DIR-882 routers with firmware 1.20B10_BETA. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the handling of HNAP requests.
