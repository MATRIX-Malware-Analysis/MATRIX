    "description": "A set of pre-production kernel packages of Red Hat Enterprise Linux for IBM Power architecture can be booted by the grub in Secure Boot mode even though it shouldn't. These kernel builds don't have the secure boot lockdown patches applied to it and can bypass the secure boot validations, allowing the attacker to load another non-trusted code.",
