    "description": "A vulnerability has been identified in a signed kernel driver for the BIOS of some ThinkPad systems that can allow an attacker with Windows administrator-level privileges to call System Management Mode (SMM) services. This could lead to a denial of service attack or allow certain BIOS variables or settings to be altered (such as boot sequence). The setting or changing of BIOS passwords is not affected by this vulnerability.",
