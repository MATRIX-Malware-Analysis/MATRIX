    "description": "A vulnerability in dynamic access policies (DAP) functionality of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an affected device to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.\r\n\r This vulnerability is due to improper processing of HostScan data received from the Posture (HostScan) module. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted HostScan data to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition.   \r\n\r    \r\n\r  https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-asa-ftd-dap-dos-GhYZBxDU [\"https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-asa-ftd-dap-dos-GhYZBxDU\"]\r\n\r \r This advisory is part of the November 2022 release of the Cisco ASA, FTD, and FMC Security Advisory Bundled publication.",
