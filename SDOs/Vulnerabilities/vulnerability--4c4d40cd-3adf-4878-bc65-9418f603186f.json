    "description": "A vulnerability in the NX-API feature of Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an NX-API system process to unexpectedly restart. The vulnerability is due to incorrect validation of the HTTP header of a request that is sent to the NX-API. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to the NX-API on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition in the NX-API service; however, the Cisco NX-OS device itself would still be available and passing network traffic. Note: The NX-API feature is disabled by default.",
