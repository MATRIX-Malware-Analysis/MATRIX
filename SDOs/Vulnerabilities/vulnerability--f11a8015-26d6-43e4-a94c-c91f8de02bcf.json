    "description": "An issue was discovered on the ENTTEC Datagate MK2, Storm 24, Pixelator, and E-Streamer MK2 with firmware 70044_update_05032019-482. They replace secure and protected directory permissions (set as default by the underlying operating system) with highly insecure read, write, and execute directory permissions for all users. By default, /usr/local and all of its subdirectories should have permissions set to only allow non-privileged users to read and execute from the tree structure, and to deny users from creating or editing files in this location. The ENTTEC firmware startup script permits all users to read, write, and execute (rwxrwxrwx) from the /usr, /usr/local, /usr/local/dmxis, and /usr/local/bin/ directories.",
