    "description": "A vulnerability in the WebVPN login process of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause increased CPU utilization on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to excessive processing load for existing WebVPN login operations. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending multiple WebVPN login requests to the device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to increase CPU load on the device, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.",
