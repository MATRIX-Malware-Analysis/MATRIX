    "description": "Dnsmasq 2.86 has a heap-based buffer overflow in resize_packet (called from FuzzResizePacket and fuzz_rfc1035.c) because of the lack of a proper bounds check upon pseudo header re-insertion. NOTE: the vendor's position is that CVE-2021-45951 through CVE-2021-45957 \"do not represent real vulnerabilities, to the best of our knowledge.\" However, a contributor states that a security patch (mentioned in 016162.html) is needed",
