    "description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to modify parts of the configuration on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to improper enforcement of role-based access control (RBAC) within the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to modify parts of the configuration. The modified configuration could either allow unauthorized devices onto the network or prevent authorized devices from accessing the network. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need valid Read-Only Administrator credentials.",
