    "description": "In function msm_pcm_playback_close() in all Android releases from CAF using the Linux kernel, prtd is assigned substream->runtime->private_data. Later, prtd is freed. However, prtd is not sanitized and set to NULL, resulting in a dangling pointer. There are other functions that access the same memory (substream->runtime->private_data) with a NULL check, such as msm_pcm_volume_ctl_put(), which means this freed memory could be used.",
