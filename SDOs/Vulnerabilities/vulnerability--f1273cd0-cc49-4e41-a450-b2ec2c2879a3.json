    "description": "In BIG-IP Versions 16.1.x before 16.1.3.1 and 15.1.x before 15.1.6.1, and all versions of BIG-IQ 8.x, when the Data Plane Development Kit (DPDK)/Elastic Network Adapter (ENA) driver is used with BIG-IP or BIG-IQ on Amazon Web Services (AWS) systems, undisclosed traffic can cause the Traffic Management Microkernel (TMM) to terminate. Successful exploitation relies on conditions outside of the attacker's control. Note: Software versions which have reached End of Technical Support (EoTS) are not evaluated.",
