    "description": "Loading a DLL through an Uncontrolled Search Path Element in the Bosch Video Recording Manager installer up to and including version 3.82.0055 for 3.82, up to and including version 3.81.0064 for 3.81 and 3.71 and older potentially allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on a victim's system. A prerequisite is that the victim is tricked into placing a malicious DLL in the same directory where the installer is started from.",
