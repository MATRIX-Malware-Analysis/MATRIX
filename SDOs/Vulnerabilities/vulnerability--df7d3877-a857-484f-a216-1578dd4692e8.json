    "description": "Unspecified vulnerability in the Oracle WebCenter Content component in Oracle Fusion Middleware 10.1.3.5.1, 11.1.1.6.0, and 11.1.1.7.0 allows remote authenticated users to affect confidentiality and integrity via unknown vectors related to Content Server.  NOTE: the previous information is from the October 2013 CPU. Oracle has not commented on claims from a third party that the issue is related to \"iDoc script injection\" in the (1) cs and (2) urm components, which allows attackers to read \"sensitive\" files, as demonstrated by obtaining the \"AES encryption key and encrypted credentials\" of the weblogic user.",
