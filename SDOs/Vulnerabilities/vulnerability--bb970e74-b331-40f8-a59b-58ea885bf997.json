    "description": "An issue was discovered in the fingerprint scanner on Samsung Note20 mobile devices with Q(10.0) software. When a screen protector is used, the required image compensation is not present. Consequently, inversion can occur during fingerprint enrollment, and a high False Recognition Rate (FRR) can occur. The Samsung ID is SVE-2020-19216 (January 2021).",
