    "description": "An input validation vulnerability found in multiple Trend Micro products utilizing a particular version of a specific rootkit protection driver could allow an attacker in user-mode with administrator permissions to abuse the driver to modify a kernel address that may cause a system crash or potentially lead to code execution in kernel mode. An attacker must already have obtained administrator access on the target machine (either legitimately or via a separate unrelated attack) to exploit this vulnerability.",
