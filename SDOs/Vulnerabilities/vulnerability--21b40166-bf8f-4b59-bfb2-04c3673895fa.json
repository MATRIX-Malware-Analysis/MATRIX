    "description": "Persistent cross-site scripting (XSS) in the web interface of SuiteCRM before 7.11.19 allows a remote attacker to introduce arbitrary JavaScript via a Content-Type Filter bypass to upload malicious files. This occurs because text/html is blocked, but other types that allow JavaScript execution (such as text/xml) are not blocked.",
