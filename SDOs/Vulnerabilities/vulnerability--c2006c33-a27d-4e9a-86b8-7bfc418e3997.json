    "name": "`CHECK` fail in `AudioSummaryV2` in TensorFlow",
    "description": "TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. When `AudioSummaryV2` receives an input `sample_rate` with more than one element, it gives a `CHECK` fails that can be used to trigger a denial of service attack. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit bf6b45244992e2ee543c258e519489659c99fb7f. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.10.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.9.1, TensorFlow 2.8.1, and TensorFlow 2.7.2, as these are also affected and still in supported range. There are no known workarounds for this issue.",
