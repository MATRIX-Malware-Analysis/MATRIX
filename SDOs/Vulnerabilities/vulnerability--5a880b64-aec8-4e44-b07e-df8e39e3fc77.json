    "description": "A vulnerability in the DNS input packet processor for Cisco Prime Network Registrar could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the DNS process to momentarily restart, which could lead to a partial denial of service (DoS) condition on the affected system. The vulnerability is due to incomplete DNS packet header validation when the packet is received by the application. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malformed DNS packet to the application. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause the DNS process to restart, which could lead to a DoS condition. This vulnerability affects Cisco Prime Network Registrar on all software versions prior to 8.3.5. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvb55412.",
