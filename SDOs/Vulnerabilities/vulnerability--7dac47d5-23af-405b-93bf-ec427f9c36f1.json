    "description": "NVIDIA GPU Display Driver for Windows installer contains a vulnerability where an attacker with local unprivileged system access may be able to replace an application resource with malicious files. This attack requires a user with system administration rights to execute the installer and requires the attacker to replace the files in a very short time window between file integrity validation and execution. Such an attack may lead to code execution, escalation of privileges, denial of service, and information disclosure.",
