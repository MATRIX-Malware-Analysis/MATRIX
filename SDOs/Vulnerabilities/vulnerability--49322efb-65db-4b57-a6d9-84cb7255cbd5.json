    "name": "Apache Tomcat: HTTP request smuggling via malformed trailer headers",
    "description": "Improper Input Validation vulnerability in Apache Tomcat.Tomcat from 11.0.0-M1 through 11.0.0-M10, from 10.1.0-M1 through 10.1.15, from 9.0.0-M1 through 9.0.82 and from 8.5.0 through 8.5.95 did not correctly parse HTTP trailer headers. A trailer header that exceeded the header size limit could cause Tomcat to treat a single \nrequest as multiple requests leading to the possibility of request \nsmuggling when behind a reverse proxy.\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version 11.0.0-M11\u00a0onwards, 10.1.16 onwards, 9.0.83 onwards or 8.5.96 onwards, which fix the issue.\n\n",
