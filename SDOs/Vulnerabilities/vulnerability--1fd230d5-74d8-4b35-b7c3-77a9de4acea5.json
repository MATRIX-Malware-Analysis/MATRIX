    "description": "mstdlib (aka the M Standard Library for C) 1.2.0 has incorrect file access control in situations where M_fs_perms_can_access attempts to delete an existing file (that lacks public read/write access) during a copy operation, related to fs/m_fs.c and fs/m_fs_path.c. An attacker could create the file and then would have access to the data.",
