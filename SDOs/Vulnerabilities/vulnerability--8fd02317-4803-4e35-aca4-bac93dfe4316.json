    "name": "Rapid7 Metasploit Pro Stored XSS in 'host' field",
    "description": "Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the 'host' field of a discovered scan asset in Rapid7 Metasploit Pro allows an attacker with a specially-crafted network service of a scan target to store an XSS sequence in the Metasploit Pro console, which will trigger when the operator views the record of that scanned host in the Metasploit Pro interface. This issue affects Rapid7 Metasploit Pro version 4.17.1-20200427 and prior versions, and is fixed in Metasploit Pro version 4.17.1-20200514. See also CVE-2020-7355, which describes a similar issue, but involving the generated 'notes' field of a discovered scan asset.",
