    "description": "A vulnerability in Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) ingress frame processing for the Cisco Aironet 1560, 2800, and 3800 Series Access Points could allow an unauthenticated, Layer 2 radio frequency (RF) adjacent attacker to cause the Access Point (AP) to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of the EAP frame. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malformed EAP frame to the targeted device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the AP to reload, resulting in a DoS condition while the AP is reloading. It may be necessary to manually power cycle the device in order for it to recover. This vulnerability affects the following Cisco products running either the Lightweight AP Software or Mobility Express image: Aironet 1560 Series Access Points, Aironet 2800 Series Access Points, Aironet 3800 Series Access Points. Note: The Cisco Aironet 1560 Series Access Point device is supported as of release 8.3.112.0. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCve18935.",
