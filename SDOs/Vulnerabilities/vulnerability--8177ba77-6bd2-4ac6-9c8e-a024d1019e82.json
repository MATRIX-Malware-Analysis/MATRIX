    "description": "A vulnerability has been identified in Simcenter Femap 2020.2 (All versions < V2020.2.MP3), Simcenter Femap 2021.1 (All versions < V2021.1.MP3). The femap.exe application lacks proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing FEMAP files. This could result in an out of bounds write past the end of an allocated structure, a different vulnerability than CVE-2021-27399. An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. (ZDI-CAN-12819)",
