    "description": "An integer overflow exists in Mapbox's closed source gl-native library prior to version 10.6.1, which is bundled with multiple Mapbox products including open source libraries. The overflow is caused by large image height and width values when creating a new Image and allows for out of bounds writes, potentially crashing the Mapbox process.",
