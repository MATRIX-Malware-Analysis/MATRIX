The device will continue to crash as long as the USB device is connected. This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS: All versions prior to 19.4R3-S10; 20.2 versions prior to 20.2R3-S7; 20.3 versions prior to 20.3R3-S6; 20.4 versions prior to 20.4R3-S5; 21.1 versions prior to 21.1R3-S4; 21.2 versions prior to 21.2R3-S4; 21.3 versions prior to 21.3R3-S3; 21.4 versions prior to 21.4R3-S2; 22.1 versions prior to 22.1R2-S2, 22.1R3; 22.2 versions prior to 22.2R2, 22.2R3; 22.3 versions prior to 22.3R1-S1, 22.3R2; 22.4 versions prior to 22.4R2.",
