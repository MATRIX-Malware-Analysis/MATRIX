    "description": "One phishing tactic on the web is to provide a link with HTTP Auth. For example 'https://www.phishingtarget.com@evil.com'. To mitigate this type of attack, Firefox will display a warning dialog; however, this warning dialog would not have been displayed if evil.com used a redirect that was cached by the browser. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 86.",
