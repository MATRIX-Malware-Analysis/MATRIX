    "description": "In Universal Media Server (UMS) 7.1.0, the XML parsing engine for SSDP/UPnP functionality is vulnerable to an XML External Entity Processing (XXE) attack. Remote, unauthenticated attackers can use this vulnerability to: (1) Access arbitrary files from the filesystem with the same permission as the user account running UMS, (2) Initiate SMB connections to capture a NetNTLM challenge/response and crack to cleartext password, or (3) Initiate SMB connections to relay a NetNTLM challenge/response and achieve Remote Command Execution in Windows domains.",
