    "description": "A vulnerability in the CLI of Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software and Cisco FXOS Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system as root.\r\n\r This vulnerability is due to improper input validation for specific CLI commands. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by injecting operating system commands into a legitimate command. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to escape the restricted command prompt and execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system. To successfully exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need valid Administrator credentials.",
