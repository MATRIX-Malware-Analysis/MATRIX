    "name": "Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved: In a MoFRR scenario an rpd core may be observed when a low privileged CLI command is executed",
    "description": "A Use of an Uninitialized Resource vulnerability in the routing protocol daemon (rpd) of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows a local, authenticated attacker with low privileges to cause a Denial of Service (DoS).\n\nOn all Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved platforms, in a Multicast only Fast Reroute (MoFRR) scenario, the rpd process can crash when a a specific low privileged CLI command is executed. The rpd crash will impact all routing protocols until the process has automatically been restarted. As the operational state which makes this issue exploitable is outside the attackers control, this issue is considered difficult to exploit. Continued execution of this command will lead to a sustained DoS.\n\nThis issue affects:\nJuniper Networks Junos OS\n19.4 version 19.4R3-S5 and later versions prior to 19.4R3-S9;\n20.1 version 20.1R2 and later versions;\n20.2 versions prior to 20.2R3-S7;\n20.3 versions prior to 20.3R3-S5;\n20.4 versions prior to 20.4R3-S6;\n21.1 versions prior to 21.1R3-S4;\n21.2 versions prior to 21.2R3-S2;\n21.3 versions prior to 21.3R3-S1;\n21.4 versions prior to 21.4R3;\n22.1 versions prior to 22.1R1-S2, 22.1R2;\n22.2 versions prior to 22.2R2.\n\nJuniper Networks Junos OS Evolved\nAll versions prior to 20.4R3-S6-EVO;\n21.1-EVO version 21.1R1-EVO and later versions;\n21.2-EVO version 21.2R1-EVO and later versions;\n21.3-EVO versions prior to 21.3R3-S1-EVO;\n21.4-EVO versions prior to 21.4R3-EVO;\n22.1-EVO versions prior to 22.1R1-S2-EVO, 22.1R2-EVO;\n22.2-EVO versions prior to 22.2R2-EVO.\n",
