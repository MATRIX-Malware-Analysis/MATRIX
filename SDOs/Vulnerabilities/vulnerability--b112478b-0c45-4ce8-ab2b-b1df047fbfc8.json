    "description": "Multiple vulnerabilities in the per-user-override feature of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass a configured access control list (ACL) and allow traffic that should be denied to flow through an affected device. These vulnerabilities are due to a logic error that could occur when the affected software constructs and applies per-user-override rules. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by connecting to a network through an affected device that has a vulnerable configuration. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass the interface ACL and access resources that would should be protected.",
