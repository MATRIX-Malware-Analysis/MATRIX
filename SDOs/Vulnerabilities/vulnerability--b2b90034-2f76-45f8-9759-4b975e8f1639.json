    "description": "A vulnerability exists in the Palo Alto Network PAN-OS signature-based threat detection engine that allows an attacker to communicate with devices in the network in a way that is not analyzed for threats by sending data through specifically crafted TCP packets. This technique evades signature-based threat detection. This issue impacts: PAN-OS 8.1 versions earlier than 8.1.17; PAN-OS 9.0 versions earlier than 9.0.11; PAN-OS 9.1 versions earlier than 9.1.5; All versions of PAN-OS 7.1 and PAN-OS 8.0.",
