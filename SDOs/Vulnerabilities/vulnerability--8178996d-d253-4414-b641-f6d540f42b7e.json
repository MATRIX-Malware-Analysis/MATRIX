    "description": "A vulnerability in Application Quality of Experience (AppQoE) and Unified Threat Defense (UTD) on Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an affected device to reload unexpectedly, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.\r\n\r This vulnerability is due to the mishandling of a crafted packet stream through the AppQoE or UTD application. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted packet stream through an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition.",
