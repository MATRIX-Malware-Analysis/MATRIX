    "description": "discourse-bbcode is the official BBCode plugin for Discourse. Prior to commit 91478f5, CSS injection can occur when rendering content generated with the discourse-bccode plugin. This vulnerability only affects sites which have the discourse-bbcode plugin installed and enabled. This issue is patched in commit 91478f5. As a workaround, ensure that the Content Security Policy is enabled and monitor any posts that contain bbcode.",
