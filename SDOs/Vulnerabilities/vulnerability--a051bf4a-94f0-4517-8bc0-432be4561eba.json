    "description": "A vulnerability in the 802.11r Fast Transition (FT) implementation for Cisco IOS Access Points (APs) Software could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected interface. The vulnerability is due to a lack of complete error handling condition for client authentication requests sent to a targeted interface configured for FT. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted authentication request traffic to the targeted interface, causing the device to restart unexpectedly.",
