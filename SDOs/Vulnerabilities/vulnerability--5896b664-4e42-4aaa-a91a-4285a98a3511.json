    "description": "On QFX5000 Series and EX4600 switches, a high rate of Ethernet pause frames or an ARP packet storm received on the management interface (fxp0) can cause egress interface congestion, resulting in routing protocol packet drops, such as BGP, leading to peering flaps. The following log message may also be displayed: fpc0 dcbcm_check_stuck_buffers: Buffers are stuck on queue 7 of port 45 This issue only affects the QFX5000 Series products (QFX5100, QFX5110, QFX5200, QFX5210) and the EX4600 switch. No other platforms are affected by this issue.
