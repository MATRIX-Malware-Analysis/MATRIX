    "name": "Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Response Splitting') in Armeria",
    "description": "Versions of Armeria 0.85.0 through and including 0.96.0 are vulnerable to HTTP response splitting, which allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary HTTP headers via CRLF sequences when unsanitized data is used to populate the headers of an HTTP response. This vulnerability has been patched in 0.97.0. Potential impacts of this vulnerability include cross-user defacement, cache poisoning, Cross-site scripting (XSS), and page hijacking.",
