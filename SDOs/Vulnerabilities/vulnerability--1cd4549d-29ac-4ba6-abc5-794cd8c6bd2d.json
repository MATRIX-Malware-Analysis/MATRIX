    "description": "clamscan through 1.2.0 is vulnerable to Command Injection. It is possible to inject arbitrary commands as part of the `_is_clamav_binary` function located within `Index.js`. It should be noted that this vulnerability requires a pre-requisite that a folder should be created with the same command that will be chained to execute. This lowers the risk of this issue.",
