    "description": "A vulnerability in the ssl_inspection component of Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to crash Snort instances. The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation in the ssl_inspection component. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malformed TLS packet through a Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA). A successful exploit could allow the attacker to crash a Snort instance, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.",
