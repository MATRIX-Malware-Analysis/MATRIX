    "description": "manager/editor/upload.php in joyplus-cms 1.6.0 allows arbitrary file upload because detection of a prohibited file extension simply sets the $errm value, and does not otherwise alter the flow of control. Consequently, one can upload and execute a .php file, a similar issue to CVE-2018-8766.",
