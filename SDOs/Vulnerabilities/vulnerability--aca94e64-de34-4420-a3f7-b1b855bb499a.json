    "description": "Unspecified vulnerability in the Oracle Application Testing Suite component in Oracle Enterprise Manager Grid Control 12.4.0.2 and 12.5.0.2 allows remote attackers to affect confidentiality and integrity via unknown vectors related to Test Manager for Web Apps, a different vulnerability than CVE-2016-0487.  NOTE: the previous information is from the January 2016 CPU. Oracle has not commented on third-party claims that this is a directory traversal vulnerability in the UploadServlet servlet, which allows remote attackers to upload and execute arbitrary files via directory traversal sequences in a filename header.",
