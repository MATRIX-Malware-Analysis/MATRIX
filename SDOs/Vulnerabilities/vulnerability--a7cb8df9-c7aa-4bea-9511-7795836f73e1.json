    "description": "A vulnerability in Cisco Nexus 9000 Series Fabric Switches in Application Centric Infrastructure (ACI) mode could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to access sensitive information. The vulnerability occurs because the affected software does not properly validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by issuing certain commands with filtered query results on the device. This action may cause returned messages to display confidential system information. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to read sensitive information on the device.",
