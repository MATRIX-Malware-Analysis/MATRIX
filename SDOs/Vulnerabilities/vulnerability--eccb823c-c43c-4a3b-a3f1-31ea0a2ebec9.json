    "description": "A vulnerability in the CLI command-parsing code of Cisco Meeting Server could allow an authenticated, local attacker to perform command injection and escalate their privileges to root. The attacker must first authenticate to the application with valid administrator credentials. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input at the CLI for certain commands. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the affected application and submitting a crafted CLI command for execution at the Cisco Meeting Server CLI. An exploit could allow the attacker to perform command injection and escalate their privilege level to root. Vulnerable Products: This vulnerability exists in Cisco Meeting Server software versions prior to and including 2.0, 2.1, and 2.2. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvf53830.",
