    "description": "In FreeBSD 12.0-STABLE before r350619, 12.0-RELEASE before 12.0-RELEASE-p9, 11.3-STABLE before r350619, 11.3-RELEASE before 11.3-RELEASE-p2, and 11.2-RELEASE before 11.2-RELEASE-p13, the bhyve e1000 device emulation used a guest-provided value to determine the size of the on-stack buffer without validation when TCP segmentation offload is requested for a transmitted packet. A misbehaving bhyve guest could overwrite memory in the bhyve process on the host.",
