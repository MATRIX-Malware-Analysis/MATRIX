    "description": "Unspecified vulnerability in the Oracle Application Testing Suite component in Oracle Enterprise Manager Grid Control 12.4.0.2 and 12.5.0.2 allows remote attackers to affect confidentiality and integrity via unknown vectors related to Test Manager for Web Apps, a different vulnerability than CVE-2016-0490.  NOTE: the previous information is from the January 2016 CPU. Oracle has not commented on third-party claims that this is a directory traversal vulnerability in the process method in the ActionServlet servlet, which allows remote attackers to bypass authentication via directory traversal sequences following an unspecified URI string.",
