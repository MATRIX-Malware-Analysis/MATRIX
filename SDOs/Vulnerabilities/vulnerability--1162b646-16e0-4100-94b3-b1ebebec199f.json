    "description": "Vivoh Webinar Manager before 3.6.3.0 has improper API authentication. When a user logs in to the administration configuration web portlet, a VIVOH_AUTH cookie is assigned so that they can be uniquely identified. Certain APIs can be successfully executed without proper authentication. This can let an attacker impersonate as victim and make state changing requests on their behalf.",
