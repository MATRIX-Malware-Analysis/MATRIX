    "name": "Junos OS: QFX5000 Series, EX4600: Device may run out of memory, causing traffic loss, upon receipt of specific IPv6 packets",
    "description": "A vulnerability in the processing of inbound IPv6 packets in Juniper Networks Junos OS on QFX5000 Series and EX4600 switches may cause the memory to not be freed, leading to a packet DMA memory leak, and eventual Denial of Service (DoS) condition. Once the condition occurs, further packet processing will be impacted, creating a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition. The following error logs may be observed using the \"show heap\" command and the device may eventually run out of memory if such packets are received continuously.
