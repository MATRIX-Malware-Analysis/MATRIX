    "description": "A certain pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) algorithm that uses ADD with 0 random hops (aka \"Algorithm A0\"), as used in OpenBSD 3.5 through 4.2 and NetBSD 1.6.2 through 4.0, allows remote attackers to guess sensitive values such as (1) DNS transaction IDs or (2) IP fragmentation IDs by observing a sequence of previously generated values.  NOTE: this issue can be leveraged for attacks such as DNS cache poisoning, injection into TCP packets, and OS fingerprinting.",
