    "description": "An issue was discovered in Gradle Enterprise before 2021.1.2. There is potential remote code execution via the application startup configuration. The installation configuration user interface (available to administrators) allows specifying arbitrary Java Virtual Machine startup options. Some of these options, such as -XX:OnOutOfMemoryError, allow specifying a command to be run on the host. This can be abused to run arbitrary commands on the host, should an attacker gain administrative access to the application.",
