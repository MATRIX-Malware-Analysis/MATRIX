    "description": "A vulnerability in the CLI of Cisco SD-WAN Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to overwrite and possibly corrupt files on an affected system. This vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by injecting arbitrary commands that are executed as the root user account. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to overwrite arbitrary system files, which could result in a denial of service (DoS) condition.",
