    "description": "The Bluetooth Classic implementation in the Cypress WICED BT stack through 2.9.0 for CYW20735B1 devices does not properly handle the reception of LMP_max_slot with an invalid Baseband packet type (and LT_ADDRESS and LT_ADDR) after completion of the LMP setup procedure, allowing attackers in radio range to trigger a denial of service (firmware crash) via a crafted LMP packet.",
