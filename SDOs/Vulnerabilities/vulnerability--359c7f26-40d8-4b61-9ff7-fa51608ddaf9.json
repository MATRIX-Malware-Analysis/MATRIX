    "description": "In TYPO3 CMS 9.0.0 through 9.5.16 and 10.0.0 through 10.4.1, it has been discovered that backend user settings (in $BE_USER->uc) are vulnerable to insecure deserialization. In combination with vulnerabilities of third party components, this can lead to remote code execution. A valid backend user account is needed to exploit this vulnerability. This has been fixed in 9.5.17 and 10.4.2.",
