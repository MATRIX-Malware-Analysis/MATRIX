    "description": "A vulnerability in the DHCP client implementation of Cisco IOS (12.2, 12.4, and 15.0 through 15.6) and Cisco IOS XE (3.3 through 3.7) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability occurs during the parsing of a crafted DHCP packet. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted DHCP packets to an affected device that is configured as a DHCP client. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a reload of an affected device, resulting in a DoS condition. This vulnerability affects Cisco devices that are running a vulnerable release of Cisco IOS or IOS XE Software and using a specific DHCP client configuration. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCuu43892.",
