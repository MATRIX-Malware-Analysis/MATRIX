    "description": "Double free vulnerability in IBM Tivoli Directory Server (TDS) 6.1.0.0 through 6.1.0.15 allows remote authenticated administrators to cause a denial of service (ABEND) and possibly execute arbitrary code by using ldapadd to attempt to create a duplicate ibm-globalAdminGroup LDAP database entry.  NOTE: the vendor states \"There is no real risk of a vulnerability,\" although there are likely scenarios in which a user is allowed to make administrative LDAP requests but does not have the privileges to stop the server.",
