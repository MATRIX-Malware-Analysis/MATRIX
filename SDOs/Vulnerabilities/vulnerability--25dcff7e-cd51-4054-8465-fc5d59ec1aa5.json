    "description": "A vulnerability in the implementation of 802.11v Basic Service Set (BSS) Transition Management functionality in Cisco Wireless LAN Controllers could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause an affected device to reload unexpectedly, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of 802.11v BSS Transition Management Response packets that an affected device receives from wireless clients. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malformed 802.11v BSS Transition Management Response packet to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to reload unexpectedly, resulting in a DoS condition. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvb57803.",
