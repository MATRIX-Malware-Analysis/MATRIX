    "description": "This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of TP-Link AC1750 prior to 211210 routers. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the NetUSB.ko kernel module. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of root. Was ZDI-CAN-15773.",
