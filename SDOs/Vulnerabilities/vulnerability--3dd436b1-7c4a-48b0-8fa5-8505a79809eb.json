    "description": "Discourse is an open source platform for community discussion. Prior to version 3.1.3 of the `stable` branch and version 3.2.0.beta3 of the `beta` and `tests-passed` branches, some theme components allow users to add svgs with unlimited `height` attributes, and this can affect the availability of subsequent replies in a topic. Most Discourse instances are unaffected, only instances with the svgbob or the mermaid theme component are within scope. The issue is patched in version 3.1.3 of the `stable` branch and version 3.2.0.beta3 of the `beta` and `tests-passed` branches. As a workaround, disable or remove the relevant theme components. ",
