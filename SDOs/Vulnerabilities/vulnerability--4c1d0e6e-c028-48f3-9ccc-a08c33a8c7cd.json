    "description": "This vulnerability allows local attackers to escalate privileges on affected installations of Parallels Desktop Parallels Desktop 17.1.1. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the update machanism.
