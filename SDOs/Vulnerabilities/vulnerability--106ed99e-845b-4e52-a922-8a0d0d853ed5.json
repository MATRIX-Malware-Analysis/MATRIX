    "name": "Weave Gitops Run vulnerable to insecure communication",
    "description": "Weave GitOps is a simple open source developer platform for people who want cloud native applications, without needing Kubernetes expertise. GitOps run has a local S3 bucket which it uses for synchronizing files that are later applied against a Kubernetes cluster. The communication between GitOps Run and the local S3 bucket is not encrypted. This allows privileged users or process to tap the local traffic to gain information permitting access to the s3 bucket. From that point, it would be possible to alter the bucket content, resulting in changes in the Kubernetes cluster's resources. There are no known workaround(s) for this vulnerability. This vulnerability has been fixed by commits ce2bbff and babd915. Users should upgrade to Weave GitOps version >= v0.12.0 released on 08/12/2022.\n",
