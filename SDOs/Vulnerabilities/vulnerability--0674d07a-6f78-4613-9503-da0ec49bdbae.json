    "description": "A vulnerability has been identified in JT2Go (All versions < V13.2), Solid Edge SE2021 (All Versions < SE2021MP5), Teamcenter Visualization (All versions < V13.2). The plmxmlAdapterSE70.dll library in affected applications lacks proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing PAR files. This could result in an out of bounds write past the fixed-length heap-based buffer. An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. (ZDI-CAN-13424)",
