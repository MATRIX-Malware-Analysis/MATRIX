    "description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco BroadWorks CommPilot application could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to perform a server-side request forgery (SSRF) attack on an affected device.\r\n\r This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to the web interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to obtain confidential information from the BroadWorks server and other device on the network.\r\n\r    \r\n\r  {{value}} [\"%7b%7bvalue%7d%7d\"])}]]\r\n",
