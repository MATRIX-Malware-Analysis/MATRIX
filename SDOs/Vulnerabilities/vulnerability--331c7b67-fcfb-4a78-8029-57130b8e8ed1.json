    "description": "A Memory Leak vulnerability exists in SQLite Project SQLite3 3.35.1 and 3.37.0 via maliciously crafted SQL Queries (made via editing the Database File), it is possible to query a record, and leak subsequent bytes of memory that extend beyond the record, which could let a malicious user obtain sensitive information. NOTE: The developer disputes this as a vulnerability stating that If you give SQLite a corrupted database file and submit a query against the database, it might read parts of the database that you did not intend or expect.",
