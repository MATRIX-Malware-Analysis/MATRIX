    "name": " Junos OS: Stateless IP firewall filter rules stop working as expected after reboot or upgrade",
    "description": "After Junos OS device reboot or upgrade, the stateless firewall filter configuration may not take effect. This issue can be verified by running the command: user@re0> show interfaces <interface_name> extensive | match filters\" CAM destination filters: 0, CAM source filters: 0 Note: when the issue occurs, it does not show the applied firewall filter. The correct output should show the applied firewall filter, for example: user@re0> show interfaces <interface_name> extensive | match filters\" CAM destination filters: 0, CAM source filters: 0 Input Filters: FIREWAL_FILTER_NAME-<interface_name> This issue affects firewall filters for every address family. Affected releases are Juniper Networks Junos OS: 15.1R4, 15.1R5, 15.1R6 and SRs based on these MRs. 15.1X8 versions prior to 15.1X8.3.",
