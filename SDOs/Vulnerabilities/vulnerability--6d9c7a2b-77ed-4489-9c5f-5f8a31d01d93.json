    "name": "vantage6 Node accepts non-whitelisted algorithms from malicious server",
    "description": "vantage6 is a framework to manage and deploy privacy enhancing technologies like Federated Learning (FL) and Multi-Party Computation (MPC). In affected versions a node does not check if an image is allowed to run if a `parent_id` is set. A malicious party that breaches the server may modify it to set a fake `parent_id` and send a task of a non-whitelisted algorithm. The node will then execute it because the `parent_id` that is set prevents checks from being run. This impacts all servers that are breached by an expert user. This vulnerability has been patched in version 4.1.2. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.\n",
