    "description": "Apple Safari for Windows 3.0.3 and earlier does not prompt the user before downloading a file, which allows remote attackers to download arbitrary files to the desktop of a client system via certain HTML, as demonstrated by a filename in the DATA attribute of an OBJECT element. NOTE: it could be argued that this is not a vulnerability because a dangerous file is not actually launched, but as of 2007, it is generally accepted that web browsers should prompt users before saving dangerous content.",
