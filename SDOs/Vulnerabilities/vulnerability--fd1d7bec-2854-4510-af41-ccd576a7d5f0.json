    "description": "The TCP MSS (maximum segment size) functionality in netinet allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (resource exhaustion) via (1) a low MTU, which causes a large number of small packets to be produced, or (2) via a large number of packets with a small TCP payload, which cause a large number of calls to the resource-intensive sowakeup function.",
