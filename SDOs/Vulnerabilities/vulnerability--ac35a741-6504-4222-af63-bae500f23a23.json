    "description": "Discourse is an open-source discussion platform. Prior to version 3.1.0.beta3 of the `beta` and `tests-passed` branches, attackers are able to bypass Discourse's server-side request forgery (SSRF) protection for private IPv4 addresses by using a IPv4-mapped IPv6 address. The issue is patched in the latest beta and tests-passed version of Discourse. version 3.1.0.beta3 of the `beta` and `tests-passed` branches. There are no known workarounds.",
