    "description": "woocommerce-gutenberg-products-block is a feature plugin for WooCommerce Gutenberg Blocks. An SQL injection vulnerability impacts all WooCommerce sites running the WooCommerce Blocks feature plugin between version 2.5.0 and prior to version 2.5.16. Via a carefully crafted URL, an exploit can be executed against the `wc/store/products/collection-data?calculate_attribute_counts[][taxonomy]` endpoint that allows the execution of a read only sql query. There are patches for many versions of this package, starting with version 2.5.16. There are no known workarounds aside from upgrading.",
