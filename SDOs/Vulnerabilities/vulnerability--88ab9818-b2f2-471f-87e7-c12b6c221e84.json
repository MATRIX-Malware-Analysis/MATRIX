    "description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Unified Contact Center Management Portal (Unified CCMP) and Cisco Unified Contact Center Domain Manager (Unified CCDM) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to elevate their privileges to Administrator. This vulnerability is due to the lack of server-side validation of user permissions. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting a crafted HTTP request to a vulnerable system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to create Administrator accounts. With these accounts, the attacker could access and modify telephony and user resources across all the Unified platforms that are associated to the vulnerable Cisco Unified CCMP. To successfully exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need valid Advanced User credentials.",
