    "name": "Cisco NX-OS Software CLI Command Injection Vulnerability (CVE-2019-1610)",
    "description": "A vulnerability in the CLI of Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system of an affected device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of arguments passed to certain CLI commands. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by including malicious input as the argument of an affected command. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system with elevated privileges. An attacker would need valid administrator credentials to exploit this vulnerability. Nexus 3500 Platform Switches and Nexus 3000 Series Switches software versions prior to 7.0(3)I7(4) are affected.",
