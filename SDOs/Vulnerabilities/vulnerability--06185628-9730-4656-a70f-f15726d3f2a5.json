    "name": "`CHECK` fail in `Save` and `SaveSlices` in TensorFlow",
    "description": "TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. If `Save` or `SaveSlices` is run over tensors of an unsupported `dtype`, it results in a `CHECK` fail that can be used to trigger a denial of service attack. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit 5dd7b86b84a864b834c6fa3d7f9f51c87efa99d4. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.10.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.9.1, TensorFlow 2.8.1, and TensorFlow 2.7.2, as these are also affected and still in supported range. There are no known workarounds for this issue.",
