    "description": "DroneScout ds230 Remote ID receiver from BlueMark Innovations\u00a0is affected by an information loss vulnerability through\u00a0traffic injection.\nAn attacker can exploit this vulnerability by injecting, at the right times, spoofed Open Drone ID (ODID) messages which force the DroneScout ds230 Remote ID receiver to drop real Remote ID (RID) information and, instead, generate and transmit JSON encoded MQTT messages containing crafted RID information.\u00a0Consequently, the\u00a0MQTT broker, typically operated by a system integrator,\u00a0will have no access to the drones\u2019 real RID information.\n\nThis issue affects DroneScout ds230 in default configuration from firmware version 20211210-1627 through 20230329-1042.\n",
