    "description": "An issue was discovered in OpenPOWER 2.6 firmware. unpack_timestamp() calls le32_to_cpu() for endian conversion of a uint16_t \"year\" value, resulting in a type mismatch that can truncate a higher integer value to a smaller one, and bypass a timestamp check. The fix is to use the right endian conversion function.",
