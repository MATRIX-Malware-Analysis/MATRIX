    "name": "Denial of service due to FPE in Exiv2::Internal::resolveLens0xffff",
    "description": "Exiv2 is a command-line utility and C++ library for reading, writing, deleting, and modifying the metadata of image files. A floating point exception (FPE) due to an integer divide by zero was found in Exiv2 versions v0.27.4 and earlier. The FPE is triggered when Exiv2 is used to print the metadata of a crafted image file. An attacker could potentially exploit the vulnerability to cause a denial of service, if they can trick the victim into running Exiv2 on a crafted image file. Note that this bug is only triggered when printing the interpreted (translated) data, which is a less frequently used Exiv2 operation that requires an extra command line option (`-p t` or `-P t`). The bug is fixed in version v0.27.5.",
