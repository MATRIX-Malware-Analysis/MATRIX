    "description": "In addAllPermissions of PermissionManagerService.java, there is a possible permissions bypass when upgrading major Android versions which allows an app to gain the android.permission.ACTIVITY_RECOGNITION permission without user confirmation. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation. Product: Android; Versions: Android-11, Android-8.0, Android-8.1, Android-9, Android-10; Android ID: A-154505240.",
