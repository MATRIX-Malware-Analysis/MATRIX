    "description": "NordVPN 6.12.7.0 for Windows suffers from a SYSTEM privilege escalation vulnerability through the \"nordvpn-service\" service. This service establishes an NetNamedPipe endpoint that allows arbitrary installed applications to connect and call publicly exposed methods. The \"Connect\" method accepts a class instance argument that provides attacker control of the OpenVPN command line. An attacker can specify a dynamic library plugin that should run for every new VPN connection attempt. This plugin will execute code in the context of the SYSTEM user.",
