    "description": "The MStore API plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Unauthorized Account Access and Privilege Escalation in versions up to, and including, 4.10.7 due to improper implementation of the Apple login feature.

We are disclosing this issue as the developer has not yet released a patch, but continues to release updates and we escalated this issue to the plugin's team 30 days ago.",
