    "description": "\nRockwell Automation FactoryTalk View Machine Edition on the PanelView Plus, improperly verifies user\u2019s input, which allows unauthenticated attacker to achieve remote code executed via crafted malicious packets. \u00a0The device has the functionality, through a CIP class, to execute exported functions from libraries. \u00a0There is a routine that restricts it to execute specific functions from two dynamic link library files. \u00a0By using a CIP class, an attacker can upload a self-made library to the device which allows the attacker to bypass the security check and execute any code written in the function.\n\n",
