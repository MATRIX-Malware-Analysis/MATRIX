    "description": "A vulnerability in BIOS authentication management of Cisco 5000 Series Enterprise Network Compute System and Cisco Unified Computing (UCS) E-Series Servers could allow an unauthenticated, local attacker to bypass the BIOS authentication and execute actions as an unprivileged user. The vulnerability is due to improper security restrictions that are imposed by the affected system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting an empty password value to an affected device's BIOS authentication prompt. An exploit could allow the attacker to have access to a restricted set of user-level BIOS commands. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvh83260.",
