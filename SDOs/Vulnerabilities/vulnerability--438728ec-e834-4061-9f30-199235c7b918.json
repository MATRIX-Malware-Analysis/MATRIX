    "description": "Bonita Web 2021.2 is affected by a authentication/authorization bypass vulnerability due to an overly broad exclude pattern used in the RestAPIAuthorizationFilter. By appending ;i18ntranslation or /../i18ntranslation/ to the end of a URL, users with no privileges can access privileged API endpoints. This can lead to remote code execution by abusing the privileged API actions.",
