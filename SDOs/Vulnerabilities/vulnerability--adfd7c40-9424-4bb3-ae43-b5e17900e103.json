    "name": "The arbitrary write vulnerability in S3Resume2Pei leads to arbitrary code execution during PEI phase.",
    "description": "A potential attacker can execute an arbitrary code at the time of the PEI phase and influence the subsequent boot stages. This can lead to the mitigations bypassing, physical memory contents disclosure, discovery of any secrets from any Virtual Machines (VMs) and bypassing memory isolation and confidential computing boundaries. Additionally, an attacker can build a payload which can be injected into the SMRAM memory. This issue affects: Module name: S3Resume2Pei SHA256: 7bb29f05534a8a1e010443213451425098faebd45948a4642db969b19d0253fc Module GUID: 89E549B0-7CFE-449D-9BA3-10D8B2312D71",
