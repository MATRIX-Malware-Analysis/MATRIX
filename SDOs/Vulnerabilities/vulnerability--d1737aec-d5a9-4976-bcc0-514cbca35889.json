The vulnerability is due to an incorrect configuration of the authentication settings on the JBoss EAP. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating with a specific low-privilege account. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to gain unauthorized access to the JBoss EAP, which should be limited to internal system accounts.",
