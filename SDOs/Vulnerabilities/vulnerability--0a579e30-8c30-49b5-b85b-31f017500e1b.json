    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Spotify Music Player 1.0.69.336. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the processing of URI handlers.
