    "description": "KioWare Server version 4.9.6 and older installs by default to \"C:\\kioware_com\" with weak folder permissions granting any user full permission \"Everyone: (F)\" to the contents of the directory and it's sub-folders. In addition, the program installs a service called \"KWSService\" which runs as \"Localsystem\", this will allow any user to escalate privileges to \"NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM\" by substituting the service's binary with a malicious one.",
