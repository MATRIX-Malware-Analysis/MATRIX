    "description": "Unspecified vulnerability in the Oracle Secure Backup component in Oracle Secure Backup 10.2.0.3 allows remote attackers to affect confidentiality, integrity, and availability via unknown vectors. NOTE: the previous information was obtained from the January 2010 CPU. Oracle has not commented on claims from a reliable researcher that this is a buffer overflow in observiced.exe that allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via vectors related to a \"reverse lookup of connections\" to TCP port 10000.",
