    "description": "The Rockwell Automation Thinmanager Thinserver is impacted by an improper input validation vulnerability.\u00a0\u00a0Due to an improper input validation, a path traversal vulnerability exists, via the filename field, when the ThinManager processes a certain function. If exploited, an unauthenticated remote attacker can upload arbitrary files to any directory on the disk drive where ThinServer.exe is installed. \u00a0A malicious user could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted synchronization protocol message and potentially gain remote code execution abilities.\n\n  ",
