    "description": "A vulnerability in the dynamic link library (DLL) loading mechanism in Cisco Advanced Malware Protection (AMP) for Endpoints Windows Connector, ClamAV for Windows, and Immunet could allow an authenticated, local attacker to perform a DLL hijacking attack on an affected Windows system. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker would need valid credentials on the system. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of directory search paths at run time. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by placing a malicious DLL file on an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges.",
