    "description": "A remote file include (RFI) issue was discovered in Enghouse Web Chat 6.2.284.34. One can replace the localhost attribute with one's own domain name. When the product calls this domain after the POST request is sent, it retrieves an attacker's data and displays it. Also worth mentioning is the amount of information sent in the request from this product to the attacker: it reveals information the public should not have. This includes pathnames and internal ip addresses.",
