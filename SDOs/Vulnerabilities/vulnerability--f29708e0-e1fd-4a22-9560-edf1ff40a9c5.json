    "description": "A vulnerability in the CLI parsers of Cisco IOS Software for Cisco 809 and 829 Industrial Integrated Services Routers (Industrial ISRs) and Cisco 1000 Series Connected Grid Routers (CGR1000) could allow an authenticated, local attacker to execute arbitrary shell commands on the Virtual Device Server (VDS) of an affected device. The attacker must have valid user credentials at privilege level 15. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of arguments that are passed to specific VDS-related CLI commands. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the targeted device and including malicious input as the argument of an affected command. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands in the context of the Linux shell of VDS with the privileges of the root user.",
