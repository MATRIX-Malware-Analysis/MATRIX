    "name": "Cisco AMP for Endpoints Mac Connector Software File Scan Denial of Service Vulnerability",
    "description": "A vulnerability in the file scan process of Cisco AMP for Endpoints Mac Connector Software could cause the scan engine to crash during the scan of local files, resulting in a restart of the AMP Connector and a denial of service (DoS) condition of the Cisco AMP for Endpoints service. The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of specific file attributes. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by providing a crafted file to a user of an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the Cisco AMP for Endpoints service to crash, resulting in missed detection and logging of the potentially malicious file. Continued attempts to scan the file could result in a DoS condition of the Cisco AMP for Endpoints service.",
