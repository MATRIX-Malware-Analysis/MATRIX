    "description": "An issue was discovered in TitanFTP (aka Titan FTP) NextGen before 1.2.1050. When installing, Microsoft SQL Express 2019 installs by default with an SQL instance running as SYSTEM with BUILTIN\\Users as sysadmin, thus enabling unprivileged Windows users to execute commands locally as NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM, aka NX-I674 (sub-issue 2). NOTE: as of 2022-06-21, the 1.2.1050 release corrects this vulnerability in a new installation, but not in an upgrade installation.",
