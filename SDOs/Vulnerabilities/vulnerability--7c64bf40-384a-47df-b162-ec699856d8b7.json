    "description": "Incorrect permission checks in Jenkins Google Compute Engine Plugin 4.550.vb_327fca_3db_11 and earlier allow attackers with global Item/Configure permission (while lacking Item/Configure permission on any particular job) to enumerate system-scoped credentials IDs of credentials stored in Jenkins and to connect to Google Cloud Platform using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another method, to obtain information about existing projects. This fix has been backported to 4.3.17.1.",
