    "description": "An issue was discovered in OxygenOS before 4.1.0 on OnePlus 3 and 3T devices. The attacker can change the bootmode of the device by issuing the 'fastboot oem boot_mode {rf/wlan/ftm/normal} command' in contradiction to the threat model of Android where the bootloader MUST NOT allow any security-sensitive operation to be run unless the bootloader is unlocked.",
