    "description": "Certain Canon devices manufactured in 2012 through 2020 (such as imageRUNNER ADVANCE iR-ADV C5250), when Catwalk Server is enabled for HTTP access, allow remote attackers to modify an e-mail address setting, and thus cause the device to send sensitive information through e-mail to the attacker. For example, an incoming FAX may be sent through e-mail to the attacker. This occurs when a PIN is not required for General User Mode, as exploited in the wild in August 2021.",
