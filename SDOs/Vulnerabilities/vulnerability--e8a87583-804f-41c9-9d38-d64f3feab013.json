    "description": "An issue was discovered in the pixxio (aka pixx.io integration or DAM) extension before 1.0.6 for TYPO3. The Access Control in the bundled media browser is broken, which allows an unauthenticated attacker to perform requests to the pixx.io API for the configured API user. This allows an attacker to download various media files from the DAM system.",
