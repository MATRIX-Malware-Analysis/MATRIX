    "name": "Vault Key Partially Predetermined",
    "description": "\nDue to the implementation of \"deriveVaultKey\", prior to version 7.10, the generated vault key\nwould always have the last 16 bytes predetermined to be \"arfoobarfoobarfo\".\n\nThis issue happens because \"deriveVaultKey\" calls \"retrieveCloudKey\" (which will always\nreturn \"foobarfoobarfoobarfoobarfoobarfo\" as the key), and then merges the 32byte\nrandomly generated key with this key (by takeing 16bytes from each, see \"mergeKeys\").\n\nThis makes the key a lot weaker.\n\nThis issue does not persist in devices that were initialized on/after version 7.10, but devices\nthat were initialized before that and updated to a newer version still have this issue.\n\n\n\nRoll an update that enforces the full 32bytes key usage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
