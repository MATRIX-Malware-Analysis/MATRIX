    "description": "An issue was discovered in the box application on HiSilicon based IPTV/H.264/H.265 video encoders. Attackers can send a crafted unauthenticated RTSP request to cause a buffer overflow and application crash. The device will not be able to perform its main purpose of video encoding and streaming for up to a minute, until it automatically reboots. Attackers can send malicious requests once a minute, effectively disabling the device.",
