    "description": "The File Manager Advanced Shortcode WordPress plugin through 2.3.2 does not adequately prevent uploading files with disallowed MIME types when using the shortcode. This leads to RCE in cases where the allowed MIME type list does not include PHP files. In the worst case, this is available to unauthenticated users.",
