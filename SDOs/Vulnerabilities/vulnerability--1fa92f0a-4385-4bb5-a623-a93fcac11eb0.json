    "description": "An issue was discovered in SALTO ProAccess SPACE 5.4.3.0. The product's webserver runs as a Windows service with local SYSTEM permissions by default. This is against the principle of least privilege. An attacker who is able to exploit CVE-2019-19458 or CVE-2019-19459 is basically able to write to every single path on the file system, because the webserver is running with the highest privileges available.",
