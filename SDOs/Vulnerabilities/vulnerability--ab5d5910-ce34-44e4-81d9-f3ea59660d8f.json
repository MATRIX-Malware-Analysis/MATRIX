    "description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business SPA500 Series IP Phones could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct XSS attacks. This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface of the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.",
