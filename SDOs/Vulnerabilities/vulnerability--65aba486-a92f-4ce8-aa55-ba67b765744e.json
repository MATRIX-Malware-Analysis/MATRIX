    "description": "In Redgate SQL Monitor 7.1.4 through 10.1.6 (inclusive), the scope for disabling some TLS security certificate checks can extend beyond that defined by various options on the Configuration > Notifications pages to disable certificate checking for alert notifications. These TLS security checks are also ignored during monitoring of VMware machines. This would make SQL Monitor vulnerable to potential man-in-the-middle attacks when sending alert notification emails, posting to Slack or posting to webhooks. The vulnerability is fixed in version 10.1.7.",
