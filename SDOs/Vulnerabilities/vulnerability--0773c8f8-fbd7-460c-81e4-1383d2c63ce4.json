    "description": "An issue was discovered in MinDoc through v1.0.2. It allows attackers to gain privileges by uploading an image file with contents that represent an admin session, and then sending a Cookie: header with a mindoc_id value containing the relative pathname of this uploaded file. For example, the mindoc_id (aka session ID) could be of the form aa/../../uploads/blog/201811/attach_#.jpg where '#' is a hex value displayed in the upload field of a manage/blogs/edit/ screen.",
