    "description": "Havoc Research discovered an authenticated Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via the \"JSON\" data source of Redash open-source 8.0.0 and prior. Possibly, other connectors are affected. The SSRF is potent and provides a lot of flexibility in terms of being able to craft HTTP requests e.g., by adding headers, selecting any HTTP verb, etc.",
