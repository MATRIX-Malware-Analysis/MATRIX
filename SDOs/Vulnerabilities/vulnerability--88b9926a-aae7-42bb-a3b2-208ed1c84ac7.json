    "description": "October is a free, open-source, self-hosted CMS platform based on the Laravel PHP Framework. In October CMS from version 1.0.319 and before version 1.0.470, backend users with the default \"Publisher\" system role have access to create & manage users where they can choose which role the new user has. This means that a user with \"Publisher\" access has the ability to escalate their access to \"Developer\" access. Issue has been patched in Build 470 (v1.0.470) & v1.1.1.",
