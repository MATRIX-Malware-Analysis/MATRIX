    "description": "DJI Spark 01.00.0900 allows remote attackers to prevent legitimate terminal connections by exhausting the DHCP IP address pool. To accomplish this, the attacker would first need to connect to the device's internal Wi-Fi network (e.g., by guessing the password). Then, the attacker would need to send many DHCP request packets.",
