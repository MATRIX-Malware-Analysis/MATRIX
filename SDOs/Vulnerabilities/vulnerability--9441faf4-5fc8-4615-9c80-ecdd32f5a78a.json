    "description": "An attacker could send an authenticated HTTP request to trigger this vulnerability in Insteon Hub running firmware version 1012. At 0x9d01e7d4 the value for the s_vol key is copied using strcpy to the buffer at 0xa0001700. This buffer is maximum 12 bytes large (this is the maximum size it could be, it is possible other global variables are stored between this variable and the next one that we could identify), sending anything longer will cause a buffer overflow.",
