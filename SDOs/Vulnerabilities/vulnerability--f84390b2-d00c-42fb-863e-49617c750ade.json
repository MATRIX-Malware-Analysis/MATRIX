    "description": "An issue was discovered in Trusted Firmware OP-TEE Trusted OS through 3.15.0. The OPTEE-OS CSU driver for NXP i.MX6UL SoC devices lacks security access configuration for wakeup-related registers, resulting in TrustZone bypass because the NonSecure World can perform arbitrary memory read/write operations on Secure World memory. This involves a v cycle.",
