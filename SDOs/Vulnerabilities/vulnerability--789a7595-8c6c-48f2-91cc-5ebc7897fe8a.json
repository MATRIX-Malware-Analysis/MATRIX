    "name": "Cisco IoT Field Network Director SOAP API Authorization Bypass Vulnerability",
    "description": "A vulnerability in the SOAP API of Cisco IoT Field Network Director (FND) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to access and modify information on devices that belong to a different domain. The vulnerability is due to insufficient authorization in the SOAP API. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending SOAP API requests to affected devices for devices that are outside their authorized domain. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to access and modify information on devices that belong to a different domain.",
