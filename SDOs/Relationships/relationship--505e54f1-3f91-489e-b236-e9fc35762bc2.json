This is a likely indicator that a binary was renamed after it was compiled.  \n\nNote: There are no standard Windows events for file modification. However, Event ID 4663 (An attempt was made to access an object) can be used to audit and alert on attempts to access system utility binaries; the \u201cAccesses\u201d field can be used to filter by type of access (e.g., MODIFY vs DELETE).
