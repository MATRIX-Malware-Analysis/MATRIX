The group has specifically used credentials stolen through a spearphishing email to login to the DCCC network. The group has also leveraged default manufacturer's passwords to gain initial access to corporate networks via IoT devices such as a VOIP phone, printer, and video decoder.(Citation: Trend Micro Pawn Storm April 2017)(Citation: DOJ GRU Indictment Jul 2018)(Citation: Microsoft STRONTIUM Aug 2019)(Citation: Cybersecurity Advisory GRU Brute Force Campaign July 2021)",
