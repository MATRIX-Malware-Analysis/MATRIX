    "description": "Monitor for executed processes (such as ipconfig/ifconfig and arp) with arguments that may look for details about the network configuration and settings, such as IP and/or MAC addresses.\n\nNote: The Analytic looks for the creation of [ipconfig](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0100), [route](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0103), and [nbtstat](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0102) processes, all of which are system administration utilities that can be used for the purpose of system network configuration discovery. If these tools are commonly used in your environment (e.g., by system administrators) this may lead to false positives and this analytic will therefore require tuning. \n\nAnalytic 1 - Suspicious Process\n\n<code>(source=\"*WinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational\" EventCode=\"1\") OR (source=\"*WinEventLog:Security\" EventCode=\"4688\") AND\n  (Image=\"C:\\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\ipconfig.exe\" OR\n   Image=\"C:\\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\route.exe\" OR\n   Image=\"C:\\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\nbtstat.exe\")</code>",
