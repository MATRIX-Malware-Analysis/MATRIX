    "description": "OSX_OCEANLOTUS.D uses a decode routine combining bit shifting and XOR operations with a variable key that depends on the length of the string that was encoded. If the computation for the variable XOR key turns out to be 0, the default XOR key of 0x1B is used. This routine is also referenced as the rotate function in reporting.[1]",
