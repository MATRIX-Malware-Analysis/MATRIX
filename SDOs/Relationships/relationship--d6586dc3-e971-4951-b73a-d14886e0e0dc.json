Enabling these mechanisms within an organization (through policies such as DMARC) may enable recipients (intra-org and cross domain) to perform similar message filtering and validation.(Citation: Microsoft Anti Spoofing)(Citation: ACSC Email Spoofing).\n\nFurthermore, policies may enforce / install browser extensions that protect against IDN and homograph attacks.",
