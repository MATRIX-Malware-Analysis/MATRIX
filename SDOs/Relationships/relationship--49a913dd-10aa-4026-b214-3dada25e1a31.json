    "description": "Monitor for user accounts logged into systems that may use [Valid Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078) to log into remote machines using Secure Shell (SSH). For example, on Linux systems SSH logon activity can be found in the logs located in <code>/var/log/auth.log</code> or <code>/var/log/secure</code> depending on the distro you are using.\n\nFor Linux systems, the Audit framework (auditd) can be used to monitor any writes to SSH log files that store information about logged in accounts such as /var/log/auth.log.\n\nFor macOS systems (10.12+), Unified Logs can be queried to show SSH daemon (sshd) messages that include information on logged in accounts. The following command-line can be used to query the last hour\u2019s worth of unified logs in this manner: <code>log show -info --debug --predicate 'processImagePath CONTAINS \"sshd\" AND eventMessage CONTAINS \"Accepted\"' --last 1h | grep sshd </code>",
