The group has also used a tool that acts as a proxy to allow C2 even if the victim is behind a router. [APT28](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0007) has also used a machine to relay and obscure communications between [CHOPSTICK](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0023) and their server.(Citation: FireEye APT28)(Citation: Bitdefender APT28 Dec 2015)(Citation: DOJ GRU Indictment Jul 2018)",
