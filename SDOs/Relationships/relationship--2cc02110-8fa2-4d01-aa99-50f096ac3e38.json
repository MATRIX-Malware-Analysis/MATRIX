    "description": "Monitor executed commands and arguments that may attempt to block indicators or events typically captured by sensors from being gathered and analyzed. Adversaries may attempt to evade system defenses by unloading minifilter drivers used by host-based sensors such as Sysmon through the use of the fltmc command-line utility. Accordingly, this analytic looks for command-line invocations of this utility when used to unload minifilter drivers.\n",
