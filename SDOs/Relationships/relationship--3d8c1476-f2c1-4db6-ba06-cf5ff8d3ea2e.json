    "description": "Adversaries may modify the binary file for an existing service to achieve\u00a0[Persistence](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0003)\u00a0while potentially\u00a0[Defense Evasion](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0005). If a newly created or modified runs as a service, it may indicate APT activity. However, services are frequently installed by legitimate software. A well-tuned baseline is essential to differentiating between benign and malicious service modifications. Look for events where a file was created and then later run as a service. In these cases, a new service has been created or the binary has been modified. Many programs, such as\u00a0msiexec.exe, do these behaviors legitimately and can be used to help validate legitimate service creations/modifications.",
