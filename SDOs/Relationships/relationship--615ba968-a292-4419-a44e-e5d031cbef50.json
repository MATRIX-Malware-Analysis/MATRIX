System and network discovery techniques normally occur throughout an operation as an adversary learns the environment. Data and events should not be viewed in isolation, but as part of a chain of behavior that could lead to other activities, such as Lateral Movement, based on the information obtained.\n\nNote: Event IDs are for Sysmon (Event ID 1 - process create) and Windows Security Log (Event ID 4688 - a new process has been created). For event id 4688, depending on Windows version, you might need to enable <code> Administrative Templates\\System\\Audit Process Creation\\Include command line in process creation events </code> group policy to include command line in process creation events.\n\nAnalytic 1 -  Suspicious Processes\n\n<code>((source=WinEventLog:\"*Security\" EventCode=\"4688\") OR (source=WinEventLog:\"*Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational\" EventCode=\"1\") \n| WHERE ((CommandLine LIKE \"%sc%\" AND CommandLine LIKE \"%query%\") OR \n   (CommandLine LIKE \"%tasklist%\" AND CommandLine LIKE \"%/svc%\") OR\n   (CommandLine LIKE \"%systemctl%\" AND CommandLine LIKE \"%--type=service%\") OR\n   (CommandLine LIKE \"%net%\" AND CommandLine LIKE \"%start%\"))</code>",
