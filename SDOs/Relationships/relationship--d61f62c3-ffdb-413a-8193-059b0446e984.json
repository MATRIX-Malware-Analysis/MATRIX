    "description": "Monitor for execution of commands and arguments associated with enumeration or information gathering of domain accounts and groups, such as <code>net user /domain</code> and <code>net group /domain</code>, <code>dscacheutil -q group</code>on macOS, and <code>ldapsearch</code> on Linux.\n\nSystem and network discovery techniques normally occur throughout an operation as an adversary learns the environment, and also to an extent in normal network operations. Therefore discovery data and events should not be viewed in isolation, but as part of a chain of behavior that could lead to other activities, such as Lateral Movement, based on the information obtained.",
