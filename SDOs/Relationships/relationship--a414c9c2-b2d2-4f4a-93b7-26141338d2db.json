    "description": "Monitor for API calls associated with finding local system groups and permission settings, such as NetLocalGroupEnum. Other API calls relevant to Local Group discovery include NetQueryDisplayInformation and NetGetDisplayInformationIndex.\n\nNote: Most EDR tools do not support direct monitoring of API calls due to the sheer volume of calls produced by an endpoint but may have alerts or events that are based on abstractions of OS API calls. Dynamic malware analysis tools (i.e., sandboxes) can be used to trace the execution, including OS API calls, for a single PE binary. ",
