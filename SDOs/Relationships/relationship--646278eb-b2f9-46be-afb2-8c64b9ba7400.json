    "description": "Monitor for newly executed processes that may clear Windows Event Logs to hide the activity of an intrusion. In an attempt to clear traces after compromising a machine, threat actors often try to clear Windows Event logs. This is often done using \u201cwevtutil\u201d, a legitimate tool provided by Microsoft. This action interferes with event collection and notification, and may lead to a security event going undetected, thereby potentially leading to further compromise of the network.\n\nNote: This search query looks for wevtutil, Clear-EventLog, Limit-EventLog, Remove-Item or Remove-EventLog inside a command that may cause the system to remove Windows Event logs.\n\nAnalytic 1 - Clearing Windows Logs with Wevtutil\n\n<code>(source=\"*WinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational\" EventCode=\"1\") OR (source=\"*WinEventLog:Security\" EventCode=\"4688\") (Image=*wevtutil* CommandLine=*cl* (CommandLine=*System* OR CommandLine=*Security* OR CommandLine=*Setup* OR CommandLine=*Application*) OR Clear-EventLog OR Limit-EventLog OR (Remove-Item AND .evtx) OR Remove-EventLog) </code>",
