    "description": "Consider use of services that may aid in the tracking of capabilities, such as certificates, in use on sites across the Internet. In some cases it may be possible to pivot on known pieces of information to uncover other adversary infrastructure.(Citation: Splunk Kovar Certificates 2017) Much of this activity will take place outside the visibility of the target organization, making detection of this behavior difficult. Detection efforts may be focused on related stages of the adversary lifecycle, such as during Defense Evasion or Command and Control.",
