Detonation chambers can be used to detect these links and either automatically go to these sites to determine if they're potentially malicious, or wait and capture the content if a user visits the link.\n\nMonitor call logs from corporate devices to identify patterns of potential voice phishing, such as calls to/from known malicious phone numbers.
