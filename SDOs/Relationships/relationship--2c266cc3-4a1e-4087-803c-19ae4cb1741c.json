    "description": "DarkGate looks for various security products by process name using hard-coded values in the malware. DarkGate will not execute its keylogging thread if a process name associated with Trend Micro anti-virus is identified, or if runtime checks identify the presence of Kaspersky anti-virus. DarkGate will initiate a new thread if certain security products are identified on the victim, and recreate any malicious files associated with it if it determines they were removed by security software in a new system location.[1]",
