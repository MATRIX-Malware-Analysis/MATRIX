For example, on Windows tasks may spawn from `svchost.exe` or the Windows Task Scheduler `taskeng.exe` for older OS versions. (Citation: Twitter Leoloobeek Scheduled Task) Suspicious program execution through scheduled tasks may show up as outlier processes that have not been seen before when compared against historical data. Instances of the process\u00a0at.exe\u00a0running imply the querying or creation of tasks. Although the command_line is not essential for the analytic to run, it is critical when identifying the command that was scheduled.\n\nAnalytic 1 - Scheduled Task\n\n<code>(source=\"*WinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational\" EventCode=\"1\") OR (source=\"*WinEventLog:Security\" EventCode=\"4688\") Image=\"*at.exe\"</code>",
