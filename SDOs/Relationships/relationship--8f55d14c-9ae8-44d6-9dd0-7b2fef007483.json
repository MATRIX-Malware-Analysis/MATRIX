This should be done extensively on all resources in order to establish a baseline, followed up on with periodic audits of new or updated resources. Suspicious accounts/credentials should be investigated and removed.\n \nEnable advanced auditing on ADFS. Check the success and failure audit options in the ADFS Management snap-in.
