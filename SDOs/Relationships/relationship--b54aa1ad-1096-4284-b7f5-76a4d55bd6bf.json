(Citation: Microsoft Security Response Center August 2017) Control flow integrity checking is another way to potentially identify and stop a software exploit from occurring. (Citation: Wikipedia) Many of these protections depend on the architecture and target application binary for compatibility and may not work for all software or services targeted.\n",
