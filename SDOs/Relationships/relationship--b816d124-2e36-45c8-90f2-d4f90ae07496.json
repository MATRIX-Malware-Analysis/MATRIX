Service accounts should only be accessible from IP addresses from within the cloud environment.(Citation: Palo Alto Unit 42 Compromised Cloud Compute Credentials 2022) For example, in Azure AD environments, consider using Identity Protection to flag risky sign-ins based on location, device compliance, and other factors. In Okta environments, configure Suspicious Activity Reporting to allow users to report suspicious logins and other behavior they do not recognize.(Citation: Okta Cross-Tenant Impersonation)",
