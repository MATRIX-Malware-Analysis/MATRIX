    "description": "Monitor for newly executed processes that may abuse the Windows command shell for execution.\n\nNote: Try an Analytic by creating a baseline of parent processes of [cmd](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0106) seen over the last 30 days and a list of parent processes of [cmd](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0106) seen today. Parent processes in the baseline are removed from the set of parent processes seen today, leaving a list of new parent processes. This analytic attempts to identify suspicious programs spawning [cmd](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0106) by looking for programs that do not normally create [cmd](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0106).\u00a0 It is very common for some programs to spawn [cmd](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0106) as a subprocess, for example to run batch files or Windows commands. However, many processes don\u2019t routinely launch a command prompt - e.g., Microsoft Outlook. A command prompt being launched from a process that normally doesn\u2019t launch command prompts could be the result of malicious code being injected into that process, or of an attacker replacing a legitimate program with a malicious one.\n\nAnalytic 1 - Unusual Command Execution\n\n<code> (source=\"*WinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational\" EventCode=\"1\") OR (source=\"*WinEventLog:Security\" EventCode=\"4688\") AND CommandLine=\u201c*cmd.exe*\u201d AND (CommandLine REGEXP \"./c.*\" OR CommandLine REGEXP \".*._ \\/k.*\")</code>",
