Remote access tools may contain built-in features or incorporate existing tools like Mimikatz. PowerShell scripts also exist that contain credential dumping functionality, such as PowerSploit's Invoke-Mimikatz module,(Citation: Powersploit) which may require additional logging features to be configured in the operating system to collect necessary information for analysis.\n\nNote: Event ID 4104 from the \u201cMicrosoft-Windows-PowerShell/Operational\u201d log captures Powershell script blocks, whose contents can be further analyzed to determine if they\u2019re performing LSASS dumping.",
