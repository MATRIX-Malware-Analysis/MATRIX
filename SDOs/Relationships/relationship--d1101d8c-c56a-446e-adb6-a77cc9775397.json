    "description": "Monitor DLL/PE file events, specifically creation of these binary files as well as the loading of DLLs into processes, that may use [Valid Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078) to log into a service specifically designed to accept remote connections, such as telnet, SSH, and VNC. The adversary may then perform actions as the logged-on user.\n\nNote: On Windows, Sysmon Event ID 7 (Image loaded) can be used to monitor the loading of DLLs into processes, including those designed to accept remote connections. This is a particularly noisy event and can generate a large volume of data, so we recommend baselining and filtering out any known benign processes and module to help reduce the number of events that are produced.",
