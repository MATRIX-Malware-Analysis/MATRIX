    "description": "Use of RDP may be legitimate, depending on the network environment and how it is used. Other factors, such as access patterns and activity that occurs after a remote login, may indicate suspicious or malicious behavior with RDP. Windows security log Event ID 4624 (An account was successfully logged on) is generated when a user logs onto a remote machine using RDP.\n\nCorrelating logon session creation events with RDP network flows can provide a clearer picture of RDP activity and serve as a useful starting point for investigating suspicious RDP connections.",
