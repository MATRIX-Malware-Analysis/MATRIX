If you have loaded a database plugin and connected to a database this module will record successful logins and hosts so you can track your access.  Kerberos accounts which do not require pre-authentication will have the TGT logged for offline cracking, this technique is known as AS-REP Roasting.  It is also able to identify whether user accounts are enabled or disabled/locked out. ",
