[LuminousMoth](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G1014) has targeted high-profile organizations, including government entities, in Myanmar, the Philippines, Thailand, and other parts of Southeast Asia. Some security researchers have concluded there is a connection between [LuminousMoth](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G1014) and [Mustang Panda](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0129) based on similar targeting and TTPs, as well as network infrastructure overlaps.(Citation: Kaspersky LuminousMoth July 2021)(Citation: Bitdefender LuminousMoth July 2021)",
