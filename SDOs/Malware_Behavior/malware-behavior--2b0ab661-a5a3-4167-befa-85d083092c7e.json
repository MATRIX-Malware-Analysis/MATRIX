        "description": "To avoid running multiple instances of itself, malicious code may check a system to see if it is already running. To accomplish this, malware authors use a mutex (mutual exclusion), also known as a mutant, to evaluate whether a system has been infected. If the mutex is running, the system is likely already compromised and there is no need to re-infect the host [1]. A mutex also serializes access to a resource so that multiple parties do not attempt simultaneous access [2].",
