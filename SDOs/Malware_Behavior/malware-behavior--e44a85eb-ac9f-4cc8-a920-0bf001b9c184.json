The infiltration purpose is to alter developed hardware components in a system destined for deployment at the victim's organization, for the purpose of disruption or further compromise.",

When viewed, the malicious attachment installs a backdoor that allows the adversary to remotely compromise the adjacent hardware development system from the manufacturer's workstation. The adversary is then able to exfiltrate and alter sensitive data on the hardware system, allowing for future compromise once the developed system is deployed at the victim location."
