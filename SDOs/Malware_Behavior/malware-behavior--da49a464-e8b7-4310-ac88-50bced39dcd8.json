    "description": "During the programming step of chip manufacture, an adversary with access and necessary technical skills maliciously alters a chip\u2019s intended program logic to produce an effect intended by the adversary when the fully manufactured chip is deployed and in operational use. Intended effects can include the ability of the adversary to remotely control a host system to carry out malicious acts.",
