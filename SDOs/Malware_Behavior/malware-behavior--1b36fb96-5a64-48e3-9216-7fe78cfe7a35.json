    "description": "Adversaries may gain access and continuously communicate with victims by injecting malicious content into systems through online network traffic. Rather than luring victims to malicious payloads hosted on a compromised website (i.e., Drive-by Target followed by Drive-by Compromise), adversaries may initially access victims through compromised data-transfer channels where they can manipulate traffic and/or inject their own content. These compromised online network channels may also be used to deliver additional payloads (i.e., Ingress Tool Transfer) and other data to already compromised systems.[1]Adversaries may inject content to victim systems in various ways, including:From the middle, where the adversary is in-between legitimate online client-server communications (Note: this is similar but distinct from Adversary-in-the-Middle, which describes AiTM activity solely within an enterprise environment) [2]From the side, where malicious content is injected and races to the client as a fake response to requests of a legitimate online server [3]Content injection is often the result of compromised upstream communication channels, for example at the level of an internet service provider (ISP) as is the case with 'lawful interception.'[3][1][4]",
