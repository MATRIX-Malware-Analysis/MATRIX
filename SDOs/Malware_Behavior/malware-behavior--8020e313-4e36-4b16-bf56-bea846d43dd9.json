    "description": "Adversaries may exploit software vulnerabilities to gain initial access to a mobile device. This can be accomplished in a variety of ways. Vulnerabilities may be present in applications, services, the underlying operating system, or in the kernel itself. Several well-known mobile device exploits exist, including FORCEDENTRY, StageFright, and BlueBorne. Further, some exploits may be possible to exploit without any user interaction (zero-click), making them particularly dangerous. Mobile operating system vendors are typically very quick to patch such critical bugs, ensuring only a small window where they can be exploited.",
