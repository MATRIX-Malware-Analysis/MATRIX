    "description": "An adversary may push an update to a previously benign application to add malicious code. This can be accomplished by pushing an initially benign, functional application to a trusted application store, such as the Google Play Store or the Apple App Store. This allows the adversary to establish a trusted userbase that may grant permissions to the application prior to the introduction of malicious code. Then, an application update could be pushed to introduce malicious code.[1]This technique could also be accomplished by compromising a developer\u2019s account. This would allow an adversary to take advantage of an existing userbase without having to establish the userbase themselves.",
