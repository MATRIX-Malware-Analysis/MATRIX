    "name": "Input Capture: Credential API Hooking",
    "description": "Adversaries may hook into Windows application programming interface (API) functions to collect user credentials. Malicious hooking mechanisms may capture API calls that include parameters that reveal user authentication credentials.[1] Unlike Keylogging,  this technique focuses specifically on API functions that include parameters that reveal user credentials. Hooking involves redirecting calls to these functions and can be implemented via:Hooks procedures, which intercept and execute designated code in response to events such as messages, keystrokes, and mouse inputs.[2][3]Import address table (IAT) hooking, which use modifications to a process\u2019s IAT, where pointers to imported API functions are stored.[3][4][5]Inline hooking, which overwrites the first bytes in an API function to redirect code flow.[3][6][5]",
