    "description": "Adversaries may abuse print processors to run malicious DLLs during system boot for persistence and/or privilege escalation. Print processors are DLLs that are loaded by the print spooler service, spoolsv.exe, during boot.[1]Adversaries may abuse the print spooler service by adding print processors that load malicious DLLs at startup. A print processor can be installed through the AddPrintProcessor API call with an account that has SeLoadDriverPrivilege enabled. Alternatively, a print processor can be registered to the print spooler service by adding the HKLM\\SYSTEM\\[CurrentControlSet or ControlSet001]\\Control\\Print\\Environments\\[Windows architecture: e.g., Windows x64]\\Print Processors\\[user defined]\\Driver Registry key that points to the DLL.For the malicious print processor to be correctly installed, the payload must be located in the dedicated system print-processor directory, that can be found with the GetPrintProcessorDirectory API call, or referenced via a relative path from this directory.[2] After the print processors are installed, the print spooler service, which starts during boot, must be restarted in order for them to run.[3]The print spooler service runs under SYSTEM level permissions, therefore print processors installed by an adversary may run under elevated privileges.",
