        "description": "Malicious code accomplishes hardware destruction. For example, malicious code may cause hardware to overheat through manipulation of power management software that controls the CPU\u2019s voltage and frequency. Destruction of hardware is also associated with cyber attacks against industrial control systems, exemplified in the 2007 Aurora test at the Department of Energy\u2019s Idaho National Laboratory that successfully used 149 kilobytes of code to physically damage a generator connected to the electric grid [1]. A more recent example is PIPEDREAM, a modular ICS attack framework that reportedly has \u201ccapabilities to disrupt, degrade, and potentially destroy physical processes in industrial environments\u201d [2].",
