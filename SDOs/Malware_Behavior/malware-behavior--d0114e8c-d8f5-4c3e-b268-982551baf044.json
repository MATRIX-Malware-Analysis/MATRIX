Resources such as AWS Systems Manager, Azure RunCommand, and Runbooks allow users to remotely run scripts in virtual machines by leveraging installed virtual machine agents. [1][2]If an adversary gains administrative access to a cloud environment, they may be able to abuse cloud management services to execute commands in the environment\u2019s virtual machines. Additionally, an adversary that compromises a service provider or delegated administrator account may similarly be able to leverage a Trusted Relationship to execute commands in connected virtual machines.[3]",
