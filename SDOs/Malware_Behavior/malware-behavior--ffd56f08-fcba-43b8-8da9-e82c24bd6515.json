    "name": "Requirements for ASIC Functionality Maliciously Altered",
    "description": "An adversary with access to functional requirements for an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), a chip designed/customized for a singular particular use, maliciously alters requirements derived from originating capability needs. In the chip manufacturing process, requirements drive the chip design which, when the chip is fully manufactured, could result in an ASIC which may not meet the user\u2019s needs, contain malicious functionality, or exhibit other anomalous behaviors thereby affecting the intended use of the ASIC.",
