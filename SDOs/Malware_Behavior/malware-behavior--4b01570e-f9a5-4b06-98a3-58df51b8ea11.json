Adversaries often target popular applications, such as Facebook, WeChat, and Gmail.[1] Due to mobile OS sandboxing, this technique is only possible in three scenarios: An application stores files in unprotected external storage An application stores files in its internal storage directory with insecure permissions (e.g. 777) The adversary gains root permissions on the device",
