[1] Copying of files may also be performed laterally between internal victim systems to support Lateral Movement with remote Execution using inherent file sharing protocols such as file sharing over SMB to connected network shares. [1]In control systems environments, malware may use SMB and other file sharing protocols to move laterally through industrial networks.",
