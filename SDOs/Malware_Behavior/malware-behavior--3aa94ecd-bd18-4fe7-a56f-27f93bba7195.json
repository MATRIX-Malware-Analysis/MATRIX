    "description": "Adversaries may attempt to dump the contents of /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow to enable offline password cracking. Most modern Linux operating systems use a combination of /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow to store user account information including password hashes in /etc/shadow. By default, /etc/shadow is only readable by the root user.[1]The Linux utility, unshadow, can be used to combine the two files in a format suited for password cracking utilities such as John the Ripper:[2] # /usr/bin/unshadow /etc/passwd /etc/shadow > /tmp/crack.password.db",
