    "description": "Adversaries may add junk data to protocols used for command and control to make detection more difficult.[1] By adding random or meaningless data to the protocols used for command and control, adversaries can prevent trivial methods for decoding, deciphering, or otherwise analyzing the traffic. Examples may include appending/prepending data with junk characters or writing junk characters between significant characters.",
