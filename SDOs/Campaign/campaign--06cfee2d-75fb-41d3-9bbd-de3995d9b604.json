    "description": "[FunnyDream](https://attack.mitre.org/campaigns/C0007) was a suspected Chinese cyber espionage campaign that targeted government and foreign organizations in Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan, Vietnam, and other parts of Southeast Asia. Security researchers linked the [FunnyDream](https://attack.mitre.org/campaigns/C0007) campaign to possible Chinese-speaking threat actors through the use of the [Chinoxy](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S1041) backdoor and noted infrastructure overlap with the TAG-16 threat group.(Citation: Bitdefender FunnyDream Campaign November 2020)(Citation: Kaspersky APT Trends Q1 2020)(Citation: Recorded Future Chinese Activity in Southeast Asia December 2021)",
