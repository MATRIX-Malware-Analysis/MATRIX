Security researchers noted this campaign against students was a significant shift from [Transparent Tribe](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0134)'s historic targeting Indian government, military, and think tank personnel, and assessed it was still ongoing as of July 2022.(Citation: Cisco Talos Transparent Tribe Education Campaign July 2022) ",
